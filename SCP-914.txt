Test 914-0200
Name: Quantum computing researcher Ling & IT-Technician Sharma
Date: 30/04/2018
Total Items: Two 2048 Qubit QPUs (Quantum Processing Unit) manufactured by D-Wave Systems.

Input: One QPU
Setting: 1:1
Output: One 2048 bead abacus constructed from silicon, aluminum, and ceramic.
The beads are arranged in four columns of ten rows, with thirty-two silicon beads in each cell.
When a bead in one cell is moved, a random assortment of other beads will move as well. No distinct pattern has been found in these movements.

Input: One QPU
Setting: Fine
Output: One 2048 QPU with "Output (Binary)" and "Output (Analog)" printed on the top left and right corners of the chip, "Input (Binary)" and "Input (Analog)" printed on the bottom left and right corners of the chip.
The binary input channel only accepts data in the form of digital signals like document files, audio files, network data, and computer programs. The analog input channel only accepts direct signals from radio, voltage, microphones, and signal generators.
The new QPU appears to convert input data in a similar way to SCP-914 in the "1:1" setting. Only one input channel will accept data at a time, the corresponding output channel will output data as a digital signal (file, network-stream, or data-stream) or an analog signal (audio signal, waveform, or radio wave).

Output: One disassembled injector and a cloud of ████████████-██████-█████████ in gaseous form.

Note: Assistant was brought back up to speed regarding the tests with SCP-914 after a short rest. - Jung

Input: One (injector)
Setting: 1:1
Output: One decorative aluminium floral brooch (Catharanthus roseus) the scent of which causes the subject to lose all recollection of events preceding for at least one day. This "scent" is immeasurable and undetectable by anything other than humans and only works at a close range, about 50 cm.

Note: Assistant Lichko has been given a hazmat suit for future testing - Jung

Input: One (injector)
Setting: Fine
Output: One Foundation Class C Amnestic Injector. The object is mostly unchanged except for the two rotary dials that have been added to the bottom of the injector. The dials appear to indicate an exact range of recollection to erase (scaling between 1 minute and 30 days).

Input: One (injector)
Setting: Very fine
Output: [REDACTED]

Note: This object, if it even is an object, is a cognitohazard. It erases all of the subject's memory when it views the item. A cognitohazard containment team has removed it from SCP-914's output chamber. Research assistant A.Y. Lichko has been transferred to the infirmary. - Jung

Test 914-0208
Name: Dr Lachlan O’Hehir, Lieutenant Rueben GreenTree
Date: 30/04/2018
Total Items: 3 Pairs of 3D glasses (Glasses are polarised 3D glasses, which is the design that modern cinemas use)

Input: One pair of 3D glasses
Setting: 1:1
Output: One pair of 3D glasses, except with a brand logo on the side (Samsung), still works as expected with minor differences in colour (compared to original)

Input: One pair of 3D glasses
Setting: Fine
Output: One pair of 3D glasses with no obvious difference, when put on, however, the viewer sees any 2D image as a 3D image and sees the 3D world with a more stretched field of view.

Note: Using the 3D glasses in the already 3D world has no use, it just makes things look marginally further away than where they should be.

Input: One pair of 3D glasses
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One mask with lenses over the eyes, when put on the lenses redirect to align themselves with the viewers eyes, the viewer experiences the world with an added dimension, 2D objects like shadows or pictures become 3D, 3D objects irregulate and create a second version of themselves, within themselves, resulting in interior and exterior shadowing. Objects will grow a 4th dimension, rather than adding onto the (X,Y,Z) axis, the glasses merge a second (X,Y,Z) Axis into the original, the 2 merged axis create 1 bigger axis of (X,X,Y,Z,Z). The second Y Axis is merged with the original, (although any 2 axis can merge). This resulted in many Class D’s who were tested on to feel extreme nausea and headaches. One account that lasted over 15 minutes with the glasses on (average time is 3 minutes before the subject pulls out) said she saw sharp, paper thin objects that were piercing through solid matter. This is presumably 1D objects gaining depth.

Note: Items were put into storage as they may be of use in the future. - Dr. O’Hehir

Input: One handbook
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Twenty-two animate origami instances depicting security personnel, and one instance which would take the form of an SCP object. They are incapable of vocalization and appear to be sapient, but requires further testing. Instances would attempt to perform a scenario of a containment breach, and demonstrate the appropriate actions in response. During the scenario, one instance would perform gestures toward nearby personnel to direct their attention to the actions being taken.

Output: 1 opal geode of the same mass & size

Note: ''Turning boring grey rock into a beautiful opal, I'm liking this thing.''

Input: 1 granite stone, 2 kg
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 miniature volcano with a single lava flow (1100 °C), Object cooled rapidly and the lava hardened in seconds

Note: ''I'll need to test this with a larger rock later. I should also make some x-rays of this volcano to determine its internal composition''.

Input: 1 granite stone, 2 kg
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 miniature replica of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. However the faces have been changed: George Washington with Andrew Johnson, Thomas Jefferson with Bill Clinton, Theodore Roosevelt with an unknown female, and Abraham Lincoln with current sitting president Donald J. Trump. The significance of these alterations is unclear.

Test 914-0217
Name: Researcher Blais
Date: 05/05/2018
Total Items: Two pairs of standard UV protection sunglasses.

Input: One pair of sunglasses.
Setting: Rough.
Output: One tinted pane of glass Dimensions 50x50x3 mm. When pointed at a light and looked through, the pane generates extreme hallucinations from the light source. Such hallucinations have included "dragons and smoke monsters" to "birds with blue flaming wings and horns like a goat". Hallucinations vary from subject to subject and seem to have no correlation to the viewer's mental state or personality. When the pane is turned away from the source, the hallucinations immediately cease and "reset" until turned back to the light.

Note: ''Multiple D-class subjects have reported seeing a "Deer with enormous antlers and crazy floating orbs" when looking through the pane of glass. Investigation into a possible connection to SCP-2845 is underway."

Input: One pair of sunglasses.
Setting: 1:1
Output One pair of aviator style sunglasses with mirrored lenses. Memetic effects occur when a person views another individual wearing the sunglasses. Subjects will exclaim and persist that the glasses are the most “extremely stylish” and “hip” they have ever seen. Further testing is in order.

Note: Definitely the most sexy pair of sunglasses I’ve ever seen in my life. I have to keep them if I’m ever going to get a date - Researcher Blais

Note: Sure Blais, of course I'm going to let you keep an anomalous object for your personal gain. I stored it in the anomalous item wing for study. Don't ask where, I'm not telling you. - Dr. Veritas

Setting: Fine
Output: One collection of five intersecting tetrahedra forming an icosahedron with a paper origami woven between the tetrahedra to spell out one of the numbers 1 through 20 on each of the twenty icosahedrons faces. The "1" and "20" faces are inked completely black, the other numbers are white paper. Rolling the "D20" has no observable anomalous effects.

Note: 3 kilo something makes for a heavy D20. - Cantor
Note: We'll use it for special occasions. - Hausdorff

Input: One print-out & one Sphere
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One origami klein bottle inscribed with SCP-3669-2, function unknown, awaiting O5 approval for the creation of an SCP-3669-1 to discern the meaning of the inscriptions.
One or two iron sphere(s). It is unclear if the spheres are truly two separate objects, or one object simultaneously in multiple locations.
The "spheres" are solid only to matter that is not the other sphere, they "phase" through each other when they touch. The sum mass of the spheres when separate is 6 kilograms, when fully phased into each other the sum mass is 3 kilograms.

Note: I don't understand these arrows.. and why is the paper klein bottle shaped? - Cantor

Note: I'm still unsure if we've solved the Banach–Tarski paradox with these iron orbs, I do know that they are giving me a headache - Hausdorff

Setting: Very Fine
Output: A sheet of paper promoting the non-existent tabletop roleplaying game Fear in the Foundation, 1st Edition. The paper repeatedly makes claims about the fun factor of the game but gives little information as to its actual content. Upon reading the entirety of the paper, subjects undergo an out-of-body experience in which they perceive themselves to exist in the game world. Based on subject’s reports, elements of the game are taken from several different tabletop roleplaying games. The game is also noted to contain several Foundation and SCP-related characters, items, and locations. Subjects will exit this state upon either dying in the game, or defeating the final villain.

Note: "I gave this a try, and ended up seeing SCP-096's face after rolling a 1 on stealth. If you don't hear from me within 5 minutes, I've blown my brains out." -Researcher Jacobson

Note: "Researcher Jacobson was later found dead in the anomalous item storage wing. Access to 'Fear in the Foundation' now requires supervision of at least one armed member of site security in case of visual hazards." —O5-6

Note: I think I need to re-iterate. Feel free to test at your own discretion but for Christ sake use common sense. I swear, when I find Wood I'm going to [REDACTED]. Dr. Smith.

Note: Due to his failure to follow basic guidelines, as well as to preserve his own safety, Researcher Wood has been transferred off-site.

Test 914-0238
Name: Junior Researcher Daniel
Date: 16/07/2018
Total Items: One large cup of Coca Cola Lime recovered from a Burger King in [REDACTED].

Input: One aforementioned cup.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A cup of brown colored soda similar to the input. When tasted, J.R Daniels said it tasted like the input, but another researcher stated that it had some Granny Smith flavoring. Each and every researcher assigned to the Light Containment Zone at that time tried the cup's contents and got a differing result. The cup was later moved to the anomalous items locker.

Note: Note to self: In this world, don't take your own word for things. That was not a lime soda, despite what my tastebuds said. Junior Researcher Daniel.

Test 914-0239

Input: One digital thermometer.
Setting: Very fine.
Output: An intricate instrument with several digital dials that change when exposed to different temperatures and directions. One of the dials seemingly moves without purpose. The symbols do not correspond to any known mathematical object to count or measure.

Note: Found out what the last dial did. It responds to minor changes in the orbital trajectory of Mercury. Mercury, like what we used in traditional thermometers. Hilarious. After four years of working with the damned thing, it's still taunting me. Carry on, people. The next person that takes out a part of the machine gets fed to the first thing with large teeth I can find. - Veritas.

Note: After some concerns raised, we should mention that Dr. Veritas is not authorized to feed his colleagues to anomalous objects. We do however, approve of his… request to refrain from using parts of SCP-914 in testing. - Site Director Hackett.

Current opening sequence is thirty-four steps.

Note: And I'm still not convinced we've actually managed to open it all the way. Though I'm pleasantly surprised at the amount of storage space in this thing. -Dr. Hadian

Test 914-0247
Name: Dr Sheldon
Date: 01/09/2018
Total Items: Eight candles each 15 centimetres in height and 1 centimetres in diameter, composed of wax and a cotton wick

Input: One of the aforementioned candles
Setting: Coarse
Output: A pile of carbon, cellulose, and hydrogen gas

Input: One of the aforementioned candles
Setting: Rough
Output: Thirty pieces of the candle each equivalent in size

Input: One of the aforementioned candles
Setting: Fine
Output: One candle, seemingly identical to the input. Upon further testing, it was discovered to burn precisely forty times longer than it should have. The flame is steady and recordings with a high speed camera have shown no more than a millimeter variance of the flame’s dimensions. The light produced is in the 590 to 560 nanometer range, appearing yellow to the human eye.

Input: One of the aforementioned candles
Setting: Very fine
Output: Candle was modified into a ball of wax with a radius of ten centimeters. The surface, upon measuring with an electron microscope, was discovered to possess no flaws even at the nanometer resolution. Through further testing, it was determined that the “candle” will spontaneously ignite when the light in the immediate area around it dropped below the level required to discern colour. Upon ignition, the candle levitates to a height of two meters and stays there until the ambient light is sufficient for human eyes. The flame it produces lacks any heat and emits only light.

A second property of the sphere has been observed accidentally by a D-Class. Upon transporting it to a secure containment unit, the D-Class passed through the cryogenic containment units. The sudden drop in temperature caused the sphere to immediately ignite. The flame it produced in response to the sub-zero temperatures did not emit any light, but produced a flame with a temperature of 10,000 degrees Celsius. The D-Class was immediately killed by the extreme heat. Object is now in secure containment in a room with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius and ambient lighting of 200 lumen.

Input: One detective, stated above
Salting: 1:1
Output: Document was altered so that every word but one was a tire.

Note: The original document read as fennel: "This is a trust to see how 914 responds to 586. It will only be on 1:1, because other settings will arouse the paper itself too much. All we want to know is how 914 intercepts with the anomalous effects of 586. I surmise this will be fun." The output reality as follows: "Their it I trust two seed how 914 retribution so 586. Ill wit octopus blue no 1:1, before ether settings wall arouse throne pies Italy you macho. Apt wry woke yo know OS who 914 intercepts writhe thin anemone electric old 586.

Output: A large bottle of hand sanitizer, mass equivalent to initial input. On the front is a sticker that reads as follows:

NEW DELUXE EXTRA LARGE SCP-914 HAND SANITIZER! KILLS 199.8% OF GERMS!

Note: Could it be? Has 914 made something useful for once? Scratch that. Apparently 914’s idea of what “germs” are also includes human skin, so now I have chemical burns.

Note: Frankly, I think you walked right into that one. -Junior Researcher Beatrice

Test 914-0252

Total Items: "Preserving the veil from the outside" - An educational pamphlet given to sapient objects in containment that have little to no understanding of The Foundation and the importance of it's mission.

Input: One of the aforementioned pamphlets.
Setting: 1:1
Output: "Mission RANGO LEPSIN FIFTY EIGHT" - A pamphlet directed at an unknown group of humanoid entities living in extra-dimensional space seemingly made by the Global Occult Coalition. Notably mentions something called "Euclid's Hammer" and threatens to activate it if the unknown entities ever attempt to reach Earth. The document explains "Euclid's Hammer" as a paratechnological device that reverts dimensional anomalies to normal space destroying everything inside.

Needless to say it is very concerning that the GOC has this. While The Foundation shouldn't necessarily control all paratech the GOC is very fond of weaponizing it which is frankly almost always a terrible fucking idea unless utterly necessary, and even then it's just because the alternative manages to be even worse. - Agent [REDACTED]

SCP-914 does not show any notable bias in this document, indicating several possibilities. It is possible that SCP-914 simply does not have the emotional capability to care about it and other SCPs' status. While SCP-914 seems at times to be entertained by manipulating it's output it has never been noted to attempt communication meaning that it may only the ability to use output as "tools" rather than an information medium. SCP-914 may also just not understand communication on any level, assuming that it understands anything at all. A less likely but still worth noting possibility is that SCP-914's interests are aligned with The Foundation's. - Dr. █████ ██████

Input: One of the aforementioned pamphlets.
Setting: Fine
Output: Several pamphlets containing [DATA EXPUNGED] that when observed is intended to cause those who observe them to see nothing unethical on any level with The Foundation's practices. The hazards did not actually seem to work indicating that SCP-914 could not bypass [DATA EXPUNGED]. Further testing of this nature is advised against.

Test 914-0261
Name: Dr. Devant. Thaumatology researcher.
I hope to find answers where Dr. Mason only found SCP-914 messing with him. - Dr. Devant
Date: 03/10/2018
Total Items: 5 Thaumatologicaly crafted letters (acting as a tracking beacons) in envelopes that will remotely write the path taken on an associated paper sheet outside of SCP-914. These letters are also sealed close with special trigger symbols in sealing wax that, when traversing boundaries of realities or alternate universes, will trigger the associated wax candles outside of SCP-914 to light themselves.

Input: 1 tracking envelope.
Setting: Rough
Output: A small pile of cinnabar, a tiny beeswax honeycomb structure, scraps of paper and a small pile of glitter (presumed to be the thaumatological writing from the letter).
Notes: The candle did not light, an outline of a human face was drawn on the paper sheet.
Yes! we're getting somewhere. No way this drawing could form the Foundation logo. - Dr. Devant

Input: 1 tracking envelope.
Setting: Coarse
Output: 1 unfolded envelope (no visible markings), one letter with SCP-3669-2 notation in glittery black ink. One unbroken wax seal with the stylized initials C.F. stamped on it.
Notes: The candle did not light, the paper showed a zig-zagging pattern being drawn across it.
The arrows on the letter do not match the chaotic movement on the paper. I'll have the letter analysed by another department. - Dr. Devant

Input: 1 tracking envelope.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A punch card labeled "FORTRAN STATEMENT" wherein 688 of the 800 positions were punched. Each of the punched holes had a shape of thaumatological significance. The surface of the card feels "waxy" and has a slight glitter like glint to it. The nature of the program on the card is being analysed by the anomalous computing dept.
Notes: The candle produced a small puff of smoke, but did not light. On the sheet of paper a pair of human eyes were drawn.
While the results of the candle were inconclusive, SCP-914 seems to be drawing a human face.
I'm beginning to believe that my plan has already failed. - Dr. Devant

Input: 1 tracking envelope.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 origami helicopter (modeled after a Bell UH-1 Iroquois), the windows are painted on with glittery black ink, the engine compartment is made of red sealing wax. After manually winding the blades the helicopter can fly a short distance in a random direction.
Notes: The candle produced a small spark and puff of smoke. A pair of human ears, a human nose & voluptuous lips were drawn on the paper.
I'm not quite sure what the candle is signaling here, it should just light itself when the seal traverses to another reality, this effect needs further investigation. The face drawn on the tracking papers is too crude to do any facial recognition on, lets see if the Very Fine setting helps. - Dr. Devant

Input: 1 tracking envelope.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 wax sealed envelope, addressed to the high school nickname of Dr. Devant, the seal was stamped with a heart symbol. Inside the envelope was a letter of rejection to Dr. Devant, written in black glittery ink. This letter is currently being investigated for cognitohazardous effects.
Notes: The candle was lit. The paper had random scribbles all over. When all five outputs on the papers were overlaid it produced a sketch of ████████ ████████████ (now deceased), a helicopter pilot and former high school romantic interest of Dr. Devant. Dr. Devant has been placed in the psych ward after excessive sobbing and showing of suicidal tendencies.

This one's odd to me. All my experiments so far have conformed to the belief that SCP-914 works via associations of the operator. Unless the good Doctor can tell me otherwise, that doesn't seem to be the case here. I would suggest against using thaumaturgy on 914, it's already weird enough as is. -Researcher K. Midaeus

Test 914-0262
Name: Researcher L. Sheele
Date: 19/10/2018
Total Items: One plastic bowl of various brands of store purchased candy, and one note containing the words "Take three pieces please."
Note - I'm hoping to get something similar to SCP-330, but less… endangering to the trick-or-treaters. -Researcher L. Sheele

Input: Aforementioned candy bowl and note.
Setting: Fine
Output: The same candy bowl and note, but with three pieces removed and set to the floor beside it. The three extracted pieces are unable to be consumed; subjects who attempt to will instead insist they are "for someone else." Remaining pieces show no anomalous properties.
Note 2- You cannot be serious. This thing is just one big clockwork smartass. -Researcher L. Sheele

Input: Previous bowl containing the remaining candy and note attached.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Contents unchanged, no effects apparent until all candy is removed. Once emptied, subjects who observe the bowl will feel excessively compulsed to fill it and will attempt to do so with anything available, including liquids, possessions of significance to the subject, vital organs (if tools capable of incision are provided,) and materials found hazardous to the subject or container. Effects are not present to those who view the object through camera feeds or photographs. Contents of the bowl showed no remarkable properties.

Subject(s): D-33874-914
Provision(s): Original contents of bowl.
Results: Subject's view of the item was obscured and was placed into testing area; contents of bowl removed and placed on a separate table. Upon making eye contact, the subject became visibly distraught and made numerous agitated exclaims about the sight before beginning to fill the bowl with candy. Once this task was completed, the subject resumed in a stable emotional state.

Subject(s): D-33874-914
Provision(s): Approximately one hundred and fifty [REDACTED], provided in a steel container and heated to 73 degrees Celsius.
Results: Subject was set up as before and told to look at the empty bowl, displaying a similar reaction to the previous experiment. After about a minute of this, D-33874 approached the container and attempted to relocate them into the bowl. Subject was successful in removing a total of four [REDACTED], receiving multiple third degree burns to both hands. Subject was detained after attempting to retrieve a fifth orally. A full analysis shows the subject has yet to recover from the effects of the object. The object received significant burns and became warped in several places.

[DATA EXPUNGED]

Note 3: The remaining tests have been removed for brevity. The object has been sent to an anomalous item storage facility and is pending classification, but I think I need to make this clarification here: I would recommend being a lot more cautious in the future regarding testing of objects produced by the "Very Fine" setting of SCP-914. They're hard to manage, harder to predict and even harder to clean up after. That will be all. -Dr. Clarentine.

Setting: Fine
Output: USB drive now has the letters, HOI5, on the shell. Contents now appear to be a downloadable game similar to HOI4 but including many more aspects not found in original. Essay pages now non-nonsensical, but further testing has revealed that reading through the entire essay gives the reader a grasp of military strategy surpassing that of histories most revered generals. Essay now held in MTF training facility Alpha for training of MTF personnel. USB Drive given to Researcher I. Darby after testing revealed no anomalous effects

Input: Novel on WW2 Tanks and Planes, assembled Panzer VIII model
Setting: Fine
Output: Unassembled Panzer VII model. Testing reveals that model is composed of a plastic paper hybrid. Novel has been refined to an instruction Sheet for the model. Presumed that the novel on WW2 tanks and planes has been refined along with the assembled model to allow for the increase in parts.
Testing on the assembled model reveals no anomalous properties other than a memetic sense of pride upon viewing the assembled model. Object left in staff room for Staff to examine at their leisure.

Test 914-0264
Name: Junior Researcher Gregorius
Date: ██/11/20██
Total Items: Two chessboards, wood with wooden pieces, initial configuration. Two booklets describing the basic rules of chess, in English.

Note - We know what 914 does with a chessboard on 1:1. I wonder what it does on other settings. - Jr. Researcher Gregorius

Input: One chessboard, one booklet
Setting: Fine
Output: One translucent "3D Chess" cube with pieces, one booklet describing the rules of "3D Chess" in 18th century Russian. The cube is made of a cellulose and protein-based aerogel with a wooden base. It is subdivided into 8x8x8 smaller cubes, the sides of which are equal in length to the sides of the fields on the original chessboard. These cubes are alternately light and dark colored. The pieces are made of hollow wood but are identical to the original pieces. Each side has sixty-four pawns, sixteen rooks, knights and bishops, eight queens, and eight kings. The pieces are arranged in columns in the original starting configuration but the booklet describes alternative starting configurations available to the players. The base has controls for highlighting one horizontal or vertical plane of the cube, this lighting operates from two AA-size batteries (not included). This highlight is non-anomalous, using ultrasound emitted from miniature speakers in the base in combination with sound-activated bioluminescent proteins in the aerogel. The total mass of the outputs is identical to the mass of the input items.
The aerogel yields easily to human touch, allowing players to move the pieces. Once the player removes their hand, the gel quickly expands to refill the space left behind retaining the original coloration of the cubes.
The rules described in the booklet are generally a more restrictive extrapolation of normal 2D chess rules when multiple extrapolations would be possible (for example, pawns can still only move in one direction, and bishops need to move in all three dimensions at once).
After sampling the aerogel, the item was assigned to Site-19 breakroom. A translation of the rule booklet is available on the intranet.

Note - due to the large number of pieces and the need to capture 7 out of the 8 kings before the last king can be put into checkmate, the games are expected to take quite long. Prospective players should allocate their break time accordingly. Also, a computer version of the game is available on the intranet if you'd like to practice for the upcoming tournament. - Jr. Researcher Gregorius

Input: One chessboard, one booklet
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One apparently wooden disk with "4D Chess" printed on it, one combined instruction manual and rule booklet in contemporary Navajo transcribed in Greek script.
When two players touch the disk simultaneously, an image of a four-dimensional hypercube is projected into their minds. The pieces inside the hypercube are arranged in a way similar to the 3D version. The players can move the pieces with mental commands. While touching the disk, they can conceptualize and visualize the four-dimensional space as easily as they would a normal three-dimensional space. This ability only lasts as long as they are touching the game but isn't limited to the game space. The rules of the game are similar to those of the 3D version.
Item assigned to Site-19 breakroom.

I'd like to requisition this item to help in my higher-dimensional topology research - Jr. Researcher C███████.
Granted. Just return it to the breakroom when you're finished - O5-██

Setting: Very Fine
Output: A ruler that can tell the length of any object it is set upon in inches. The ruler then messages how long said object it is placed upon by sending a text message to the person who placed it on the objects' phone, if the person who placed the ruler has no phone, they will receive a letter with the length of the measured item within the next hour, regardless of where they are, and who they are. Both the text message and the letter say that they come from "unknown contact" and are sent from the coordinates of the ruler at the time the object was measured. Attempts to trace the contact have resulted in the location of the ruler.

Note: This is surprisingly useful. -Researcher Harris

Test 914-0276
Name: Chief Security Officer Wright

Test 914-0277
Name: Dr. Lefèvre‑Gineau
Date: 12/11/2018
Total Items: Five copies of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK), these metal cylinders are made of a platinum-iridium alloy at a 9 to 1 ratio. These (soon to be obsolete) weights are used as the standard to define the kilogram.

Input: One IPK
Setting: Rough
Output: One 902.36g cube of platinum & One 97.64g sphere of iridium.

Input: One IPK
Setting: Coarse
Output: One platinum-iridium alloy meteorite, when cut in half the meteorite showed a Widmanstätten pattern.

Normally the Widmanstätten pattern would not form in a platinum-iridium based meteorite. The sight is mesmerizing though - Dr. Lefèvre‑Gineau

Input: One IPK
Setting: 1:1
Output: One platinum-iridium alloy rod precisely 1 meter long with a diameter of roughly 3.88mm.

Input: One IPK
Setting: Fine
Output: One square platinum plate with an iridium "antenna" protruding on its far side. The plate has a radial meter embossed on its center ranging from 0 to 5, from its center protrudes an iridium needle pointing towards the "one" position. This needle moves to higher & lower positions when the device is pointed toward anomalous phenomena. No interior parts have been found.

I believe this device to be a hume-meter of some kind, however, it responds to anomalous objects in different ways than a standard Foundation hume-meter, as if it's measuring true reality compared to relative reality. - Dr. Lefèvre‑Gineau

Input: One IPK
Setting: Very fine
Output: One platinum weighing mass with tapered handle & ornate embossments of the phrase "1 kilogram" in various languages. X-ray imaging of the device showed an internal space filled with iridium metal parts moving continuously and chaotically. Its anomalous effect is made apparent when the "weight" is placed on the surface of an object that is not fastened to the ground in some way, this object will now weigh exactly one kilogram regardless of local gravity or acceleration. The object behaves like a regular weighing mass when used on a balance scale.

I recommend using magnetic boots when carrying this weight, walking whilst weighing only one kilo has proven to be very difficult. Dr. Lefèvre‑Gineau

Note: Again? Seriously? The next person caught attempting to create a reality bender waifu with 914 will be rewarded with a bullet in the head. -Senior Researcher ██████

Addendum: When cleaning up 914, a clock was found at the output booth. The hour hand always points at Dr. Veritas, the minute hand always points at Dr. Cleveland, and the second hand always points at Maintenance Technician Johnson. The clock would also constantly rotate such that the "V" marking always point towards the entity resembling Grizzly MkV. Security footage has shown that the entity used 914 at the "Very Fine" setting in an attempt to alter the automatic pistol.

Test 914-0329
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 09/01/2019
Items: One set of United States history books (totaling four books: 1776-1861, American Civil War, 1865-1945, 1945-2015), a lock of hair taken from the contained entity resembling Grizzly MkV

Come on, another hate rant? And to say that the Foundation was solely responsible for all genocide campaigns in the 20th Century is utter ████████. Nazism was a real thing, for starters. Also, recognize the facts and the severity of the so-called God Gene before giving this kind of anti-Foundation propaganda. Though to their credit, they did manage to obliterate that fallen star. Parts of the Anthology could be a great referential tool. -Dr. Cleveland

Input: Lock of hair from entity (testing approved by the O5 Council as the entity is not hostile)
Setting: Fine
Output: The hair is apparently tied into the form of the 10_11 knot.

Output: One rifle barrel, one stock, a pile of screws, a pile of springs, a pile of slides, one sight, one demagnetized compass float, one glass hemisphere, one trigger guard, one trigger, one miniature sundial, and a few drops of water on the floor of the output chamber.

Input: One Aforementioned Air Rifle
Setting: 1:1
Output: One custom Daisy "Red Ryder" carbine-action, two hundred shot Range Model air rifle with a compass and sundial in the stock. The rifle was briefly tested on the firing range, determined to be non-anomalous, and produced results which were within one standard deviation of a normal Red Ryder.

Note: At this point, Researcher Reis instructed that the rifle be tested at the firing range while she retrieved something, and left the testing chamber. She returned with a thumb drive and added an impromptu step to the end of planned procedure.

Input: One Aforementioned Air Rifle
Setting: Fine
Output: One Daisy "Buck Jones" Air Rifle. When test-fired, the actual muzzle velocity was equivalent to the maximum muzzle velocity of an average Buck Jones rifle. Shots were also more accurate at range despite being smooth-bore. No other anomalous properties were detected.

Input: One Aforementioned Air Rifle
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One Gaussian Handcannon with a miniature sextant and a spring-powered clock in the butt. Weight was equivalent to input rifle. Clock is functional but unwound, ammunition and batteries were not included. Object being tested for anomalous properties prior to test-firing.

Note: I'm not sure what I expected, but such an anachronistic combination is fascinating. - Researcher Reis

Input: One Custom Daisy "Red Ryder" from prior test, 1 Thumb Drive containing one copy of A Christmas Story
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One Custom Daisy "Red Ryder" carbine-action, two hundred shot Range Model air rifle with a compass and sundial in the stock. Further inspection reveals the stock is engraved with the words "Ol' Blue". The rifle appears to have a memetic effect; if an individual attempts to aim it while observers are present, one will state "You'll shoot your eye out." It is unknown if the gun has any secondary properties, as nobody has fired it. Object has been contained in a gun safe, awaiting further classification.

Note: Under no circumstances should anyone with an instance of SCP-718 be permitted to touch this. - 05-█

Note: Well, that was an interesting experience. It took me a couple of minutes to figure out what this did. - MT Johnson

Input: One 11/16 inch wrench
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One outwardly unaltered wrench which will teleport to the vicinity of MT Johnson whenever it is not being observed. It has no observable range and nothing has been able of inhibit the effect aside from constant observation of the wrench itself. Regardless of it’s condition upon disappearance, the unobserved portion of it will always appear whole and undamaged.

Note: It’s both useless and apparently impossible to get rid of. Anyone got any ideas on how to undo an anomalous quantum entanglement link? - MT Johnson

Input: A pair of "Versace" brand spectacles
Setting: 1:1
Output: One pair of "Prada" brand sunglasses

Input: A pair of "Versace" brand spectacles
Setting: Fine
Output: Two dark tinted monocles. No anomalous properties.

//Note: Uh, that was unexpected. I would've thought that the result would be a super good pair of glasses or something like that. I guess it works though. - Researcher Mikk

Input: A pair of "Versace" brand spectacles
Setting: Very fine
Output: One knife with a glass blade. When used to cut something, it will heat up to roughly 3000°C. This heat is strong enough to cut iron, gold and steel, and has proven to be a great weapon, if not completely deadly as the heat from the blade completely cauterizes the wound, stopping external bleeding but causing severe internal bleeding. Strangely, the heat does not seem to affect the holder of the knife, who does not need to wear any protective gear or get any burns on their body. Further analysis needed. It is currently being held in the Site-37 armory.

Note: I guess you could call this… a glass cannon? - Researcher Mikk

Note: I moved the knife to a containment locker, where it belongs. And Mikk, I'm revoking your testing privileges for this and for that last joke. - Veritas

Note: I'm guessing some kind of Enigma code? Maybe a modified version of Caesar?

Input: Output from 1:1 experiment

Note: Might as well see if we can't get anything more vibrant.

Setting: Fine
Output: A holographic rainbow coated sketchbook. Anomalous property realized when attempting to draw in the sketchbook. All users will, regardless of previous artistic skill, seemingly have the ability to draw anything they can desire, with no inherent flaws in the design.

Output: One MadCatz Gamecube Controller

Huh, would have guessed another controller from a different console. -Researcher Ed

Input: 1 Gamecube Controller
Setting: Fine
Output: One Generic Gamecube controller. When used, the plastic seems to form to support the user's hand. Additionally, all buttons except for the shoulder buttons have an extremely short travel distance, and therefore responsiveness.

Upon prolonged use, the controller heated up and fused with another researcher's hand, causing fourth-degree burns, and destroying itself in the process.

Input: Two Gamecube controllers
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One Generic Gamecube controller. However, when collected, the controller appeared to fuse with Researcher Ed's hand quickly, causing 5th-degree burns. After the fusing "process" finished, Researcher Ed's hands had become black, amorphous objects. Upon a medical examination, it appears that his hands have completely disappeared. Examination of the black amorphous objects have shown that it contains some kind of alloy, additionally, it appears Researcher Ed has a degree of control shaping the objects into an imaginable solid made of the alloy. Further testing is required.

This is a weird feeling. I can feel whatever these touch, even though they aren't fingers. Also it really hurt. It's also an experience relearning to type and write with these "fingers" -Researcher Ed

Output: One $1 USD coin, which appears to have been made by tightly compressing the original paper bill into the shape of a coin.

Input: One bill
Setting: 1:1
Output: One "-$1" USD bill, which largely resembles a standard $1 USD bill except that all instances of "1" are replaced with "-1", and the print's color has been inverted as if it were a photonegative of the original bill. It is assumed that this bill represents a negative amount of currency but otherwise displays no abnormal properties.

Note: Still having trouble wrapping my head around how this would work in normal economics. - Dr. Natalidae

Input: One bill
Setting: Fine
Output: One visually unaltered $1 bill. When assigned D-Class was about to retrieve the output, it autonomously shifted out of his reach. Subsequent attempts to capture the output were met with similar resistance, with it rapidly outmanoeuvring anyone who came near it. The bill was able to escape the testing chamber and went out into the halls of Facility 23, where it spent a total of 43 minutes eluding capture attempts until several researchers coordinated to corner and trap it in the incinerator room, where it was promptly disposed of.

Total Items: 1 piece of empty sheet music, 1 jar of ink.

Note: Since I'm such a creativity nut, lets see if 914 can create music.

Input: Above materials
Setting: fine
Output: 1 piece of ink-soggy sheet music, 1 toppled over jar of ink. Surprisingly, there does appear to be notes placed on the lines, and further examination shows it to be an excerpt of Franz Liszt's etude "La Campanella". It is unknown if the jar of ink tipping over was accidental or purposeful work of SCP-914.

Note: Well, It did technically qualify for the results of the experiment, but now I'm wondering why it would choose such a weird etude to print, considering it was one of the etudes where it's artist was accused of selling their soul to the devil just to print and play it.

Setting: 1:1
Output: Magnifying glass with a concave lens

Input: One magnifying glass
Setting: Fine
Output: The plastic was changed into a lens shaped object in a glass frame, and was noted to vibrate slightly, further inspection revealed it treated sound as light, the focal points for the sound being the same as the original lens.

Note: Item handed over to the acoustics lab for further inspection. – Dr. Playford

Input: One magnifying glass
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Plastic cylinder 4cm in diameter and 5 in length, with an undetermined number and configuration of lenses inside, the object can be looked through either end. It displays an orthographic projection of whatever the object is pointed at.

Note: We pointed this thing at the Moon and managed to see individual pebbles and dust particles on the lunar surface, however, due to the nature of orthographic projection, only a 12.5cm2 area can be observed, making this an extremely powerful telescope, as long as you only want to see post-it sized bits of whatever you’re looking at. – Dr. Playford

Output: What appears to be an autobiography of a "Stanislava Mikhailovna Kalashnikova" titled The Artificial Daughter, dated 2064. Reference material not found in the book is in the form of two 32GB SD cards. Experimenting showed that there is a 0.4 percent chance that when placed in the vicinity of a submachine gun, it would convert into an AKS-74U. Placed in secure storage as Kalashnikov never had a daughter named Stanislava.

Test 914-0358
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 20/01/2019
Total Items: Files pertaining to Mary Talish, a biography of former President Richard Nixon authored by John A. Farrell (Richard Nixon: The Life), An American Life authored by former President Ronald Reagan, Known and Unknown: A Memoir by Donald Rumsfeld

Input: All of the above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Four books:
1. A book titled They Led Us to Midnight: The Last Presidents of America, authored by Doris Goodwin, dated 2015. This book mentions the last presidents of the United States as Richard Nixon (1969-1977, 37th), Jerry Brown (1977-1981, 38th), Ronald Reagan (1981-1985, 39th), Mary Talish (1985-1989, 40th), and Donald Rumsfeld (1989-1993, 41st). The 25 years were marred with controversy, and culminated with a nuclear war with the Soviet Union under Gennady Yanayev (General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 1985-1993) after a nuclear false alarm on November 22, 1993. It was stated that a system malfunction in the Dead Hand / Perimeter nuclear weapons control system misinterpreted a background signal as 6 Minuteman ICBMs heading for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, thus causing the nuclear war.
2. An autobiography titled Murder, They Wrote by Mary Talish, dated 1992. It details her ritual murder and subsequent resurrection in 1952, her senatorial career from 1967 to 1977, her vice presidency from 1977 to 1981, and her presidency from 1985 to 1989. A foreword, written by Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter, suggested that American-Soviet relations deteriorated rapidly after Talish's presidency ended.
3. A book titled United Counties of Indiana: The Founding of a Nation by Former Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, dated 2015. It detailed the first twenty years of Indiana and Illinois after the Nuclear War of 1993. Of note was the appearance of Site-81 Director Oliver J. Rights as President of Indiana from 2007 to 2011.
4. An autobiography titled Our Struggle: Memories of Athens by Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of the Imperial Union of Greece, Samothrace, Cyprus and Turkey (Greek: Η Αυτοκρατορική Ένωση της Ελλάδας, η Σαμοθράκη, η Κύπρος και η Τουρκία), dated 2020. It detailed his life from after the nuclear war, being one of the few who witnessed a nuclear bomb hitting Athens without exploding. The current monarch is Paul II (Pavlos II), following Constantine II's abdication in 1996 in exchange for the restoration of the Greek Monarchy.
In books 1 and 4, a world map is seen. One could infer that continental Eurasia, the British Isles, the former Soviet Union, and North America is heavily devastated. All four placed into secure storage pending further review.
Note: So it turns out that Mary Talish could have done much more in her life. However, a nuclear war is probably the last thing we would want to see. -Cleveland

Test 914-0362
Name: Maintenance Technician Johnson
Date: 23/01/2019
Total Items: One 10cm cube of steel, one artificial fireplace log, the contents of 10 bags of ██████
brand fruit snacks

Note: Since 914 at least partially operates by intent of the operator and purpose of the items inserted, I want to see how it reacts to a set of items with no single purpose. Don't worry, neither the log nor the fruit snacks contain any natural ingredients, so there's no chance of biological contamination.

Input: All of the above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One 20 cm cube of an unknown alloy. Testing shows it to be made up of an even mix of all of the input items. The alloy has a much worse structural stability than steel, as well as the anomalous properties of being flammable and gaining the same texture and hardness of a fruit snack when bitten into. However, the combination of materials making it up would mean that any attempt to eat any amount of it would almost certainly be fatal.

Note: I wasn't expecting it to give me something as cohesive as this. It almost seems like it noticed that I was more interested in it rather than the stuff I was putting into it and didn't put much effort into refining the materials. If we ever need a small supply of a structurally unstable, flammable, and edible metal, it'll be in anomalous item storage. - MT Johnson

Test 914-0367
Name: Researcher Boston K.
Date: 24/01/2019
Total Items: Three binders full of SCP files.

Input: One black binder containing files of SCP-1100 through SCP-1399.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One blue and green binder, containing the plots of all Shaun the Sheep episodes.
Note: What else could I say but "thank you"? -Boston

Input: One white binder containing files of SCP-2700 through SCP-2999, with a small note in front stating that SCP-2935 is not included.
Setting: Fine
Output: A novel titled Dead Days, ostensibly authored by alternatehistory.com Administrator Ian. The premise is the mass teleportation of Utah, the Colorado Western Slope, the Navajo and Hopi Nations (sans Tohajilee Indian Reservation), San Juan, McKinley and Cibola Counties, NM, Alamo, NM and Uinta County, WY from SCP-2935 on April 20, 2026, to the regular world on April 20, 1626, and at the same time resurrecting everyone within it.
Note: 914, you are a God forsaken heretic. -Boston

Input: One red binder containing files of SCP-3700 through SCP-3999, with the front cover printed with a warning stating that SCP-3930 does not exist.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The first item that came out was an anti-Foundation poster by the Christian Democratic Union, dated 2017. On it was the Foundation logo with a Swastika in the middle. The texts read "Secure. Contain. Protect. Exterminate." (Sichern. Enthalten. Schützen. Vernichten.), "Never Forget the Holocaust." (Vergiss Niemals den Holocaust.), and "Vote for the Union Parties." (Stimmen Sie für die Unionsparteien.) It should be noted that according to The Eleventh Hour, Germany was part of the United States-led Bloomington Alliance (other important members included Poland, Italy and India, with Russia being in an associated state status), which uprooted much of the SCP Foundation in a ten-year war (it was a few years after the war ended when the titular military operation took place).
The second item was a political commentary by Popular Socialist Party of Mexico Chairwoman Esther Amalia Zapatista titled Our Ultimate Revolution: 13 Reasons Why Capitalism Will Fail, dated 2047. In the book, Ms. Zapatista claimed that the existing Capitalist world is fundamentally flawed, and with the possible yet controversial exceptions of Cuba, Finland, Iceland, and Estonia, no country has came close to attaining real, egalitarian Socialism. The opening quote of the book, "You don't walk away from Gethsemane", implies that blood would be shed on the path to achieving Socialism.
Both items placed into secure storage.

Note: And here I was, thinking what the absolute ████ was wrong with the existing system. This Zapatista person sure is good at debating and persuading, but the problem is: in a world of political █████████, can Socialism ever triumph? - Boston

Note: When you're done debating philosophy with a malfunctioning inanimate object, Site Director Hackett would like to know how you obtained 898 classified files, some of which above your clearance level. Don't tell me, I don't want to know. - Dr. Veritas

Test 914-0368
Name: Assistant Researcher Erickson
Date: 26/01/2019
Total Items: Two flash-drives, each containing the entire foundation dossier on Dr. Beiderman.

Note: This test was never approved by any senior staff.

Input: One flash-drive.
Setting: Fine
Output: One bust of Dr. Beiderman, made out of the same materials as the hard drive, with an equivalent mass.

That's not what I needed, 914. C'mon, help me out here. I need to find him. -Assistant Researcher Erickson.

Input: One flash-drive.
Setting: Fine
Output: One flash-drive. Said flash-drive contained all previously redacted details on the current whereabouts of Dr. Beiderman.

Note: Thank you 914. -Assistant Researcher Erickson

Note: The current whereabouts of Assistant Researcher Erickson are unknown. Anybody who encounters him is to apprehend him IMMEDIATELY. He is in possession of information above his clearance level.- Security Chief Ozark

Test 914-0369
Name: Jr. Researcher Stan
Date: 26/01/2019
Total Items: One solid-state USB drive with a capacity of 128 GB. Drive is empty and unformatted.

Note: I wanted to see if 914 could write information onto a drive, and if so what it might put in there. I have a Windows computer on a closed system with no internet or system access. This will be tested with the drive. - Stan

Input: One SSD, empty
Setting: 1:1
Output: One SSD with a USB compatibility. Appears to be a different model than the input device. The drive has a small switch on the top, with the activated position marked with an engraved 'X'. The computer appeared unable to recognize the drive when plugged in, disallowing any manual transferring of files. When the switch was pushed to the 'X' position, the computer malfunctioned. Upon further testing, it appears the drive deletes "System32" off of any computer running Windows OS when the switch is activated. Item has no effect on non-Windows operating systems.

Note: Later that day, a researcher wearing a plastic Guy Fawkes mask entered secure storage using proper security clearance and stole the drive. All Windows computers connected to the Foundation system later came under malware attack despite foundation security software and were disabled via deletion of System32. The researcher responsible was identified through the records of the security card scanner. The researcher has been fired and amnesticized.

Note: I don't think he realized that all of the important Foundation computers run SCP OS. -Stan

Attached to the exterior of the box is a handle, which is attached to a crank. The crank moves fluid through the box for as long as manual force is applied to it.

Input: 1 TAH
Setting: 1:1
Output: Two ventricular assist devices, one intended for placement in the right side of the heart; the other intended for placement in the left side of the heart.

Note: The output machines each take the function of the heart's pumping action. The one intended for the right side of the heart isn't used much in practice due to high risk of complications, which is why the TAH was created. Essentially, 1 artificial heart = two 12 artificial hearts.

Input: 1 TAH
Setting: Fine
Output: Nothing is initially observed in the output chamber. Closer inspection of the surfaces shows a thin accumulation of dust that was not present previously. The dust is later revealed to be millions of individual nanoparticulate mechanisms. Chemical analysis of the immediate environment as well as shavings of the output chamber's interior reveal a significant increase in oxygen and extrinsic nutrients.

Note: The purpose of the cardiovascular system is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. The nanoparticles apparently achieve this via controlled diffusion, without the need for an organ or delivery system.

Input: 1 TAH
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Native materials of the TAH have been rearranged to resemble several fruits and vegetables (inedible). A perfectly functioning pedometer was also retrieved.

Note: Seems to be suggesting preventative care.

Note: About what I expected, but that's not the Foundation's actual slogan. Perhaps it's my perception of it? - MT Johnson

Input: 1 abridged copy of MT Johnson's personnel file
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The file now contains several pages of the word "maintain" handwritten over and over in printer ink. Writing confirmed as identical to that of MT Johnson. Writing starts out normally but gets rougher and rougher as it progresses, as well as containing an increasing number of capital letters. By the end it is barely legible as well as being entirely capitalized. The folder has what appears to be an emblem made up of a pair of crossed wrenches pressed into it's front and back as well.

Note: This feels like its from the typewriter scene from The Shining. I'm just going to leave this in secure storage and try to forget that this ever happened. - MT Johnson

Total Items: Three 1 dram samples of SCP-837

Input: 1 dram of SCP-837, rolled into a ball.
Setting: Rough
Output: The entire 3mx2.1mx2.1m output chamber was initially filled with clay, with small lines noticeable along the surface. Upon applying slight pressure to empty the chamber, the clay began collapsing in on itself, eventually setting down to a single dram of clay. Final sample demonstrates consistent properties of SCP-837.

Input: 1 dram of SCP-837, rolled into a ball.
Setting: Coarse
Output: 2 clay balls of different sizes, measured as weighing 2 drams and 0.5 drams. Both balls were able to have 1 dram chunks removed without affecting mass, consistent with SCP-837. While the 2 dram ball could be combined and removed as normal, adding the 0.5 dram sample to a 3 dram sample resulted in a 1.5 dram sample which could not be restored. Adding the 2 dram sample resulted in a standard 3 dram sample, which could not be further factorized.

Input: 1 dram of SCP-837, rolled into a ball
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 clay ball, weighing 1 pennyweight, exhibiting similar features to SCP-837. Sample could not be combined with standard instances of SCP-837.

Input: One computer mouse
Setting: Fine
Output: A ball computer mouse resembling a stylized mouse, uses its ball to move away from anyone approaching but does not appear to be sentient in any way, when plugged into a compatible device it ceases all movement and functions as a normal mouse.

Note: Its top speed is 0.2m/s so it’s fairly easy to catch, not at all ergonomic. – Dr. Playford

Input: One computer mouse
Setting: Fine Very Fine
Output: A ball computer mouse, all manufacturers markings are absent and aside from the buttons it has no seams. When plugged into a compatible device it functions normally, is notably more accurate than comparable ball mice from the same era and removes all forms of mouse acceleration.
It also overrides and assumes control of all mouse pointers in a 20 50 100m radius.

Note: I would like to apologize to all staff members whose work was interrupted between 12:00 and 13:00 before that last bit was discovered, the mouse has been incinerated – Dr. Playford

Note: The closest on-site infirmary was 125 meters away. Don't know how that would've ended, probably medical file deletion? Either way, I'm surprised this came from a "Fine" input. - Dr. Range

Note: Correct, was supposed to be "Very Fine," fixed. – Dr. Playford

Note: I would like to be administered with Class-A amnestics immediately before I continue with the experiments. -Cleveland.

Input: One administrative map of Novosibirsk Oblast (Russian: Новосиби́рская о́бласть), 1:100000 size.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: No change in initial appearance. However, once swiped by a hand, the location would shift with respect to the motion of the hand. All de facto administrative divisions, correct as of the present, up to the fourth-tier, as well as rivers, can be seen on the map. However, the map ratio is always strictly 1:100000 regardless of position. No anomalous effects occur if the map is folded.

Note: When I shifted it to French Guiana, it apparently treated the French Region as an independent state, with its Arrondissements (3rd tier in France) and Communes (5th tier in France) treated as its first and second tier administrative regions. -Cleveland

Note: Right now, I've set the map to the area of Georgia, Abkhazia, both Ossetias, and that whatever Karachay-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria that is. It's in the break room for those of you wanting it. -Cleveland

Input: All of the above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: What appears to be a script where Dr. Jenkins and Cassy introduces a number far larger than Graham's Number, expressed in Knuth's Up-Arrow Notation and Conway Chained Arrow Notation as (θ′↑↑↑↑θ′) → (θ′↑↑↑↑θ′) → (θ′↑↑↑↑θ′) → (θ′↑↑↑↑θ′) → (θ′↑↑↑↑θ′) → (θ′↑↑↑↑θ′). The number itself has a cognitohazardous effect that, if fully enumerated (which, given current technology, is impossible given the impossibility to calculate the full value of Graham's Number), will wipe out all life (up to and inclusive of SCP-682) in the universe. As the existence of θ′ itself has been contained, it is necessary for researchers to be notified of this derived number.

Note: By inserting files of a researcher and an SCP subject, I ended up with this cognitohazard of a number. To whoever is next, I have this warning: 914 is unpredictable. Don't mess it around. -Cleveland

Name: Jr. Researcher Stan
Date: 19/02/2019
Total Items: One squeezable plastic pouch of instant drink mix, fruit punch flavored

Input: Drink mix
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A similarly shaped pouch to the original. The label read "Bombastic Explosive Flavor!" with no nutrition information or ingredients.

Note: We've decided to test this in a reinforced chamber with a remote arm. I think you know why. -Stan

Results: A technician operated the remote arm from behind reinforced glass with Jr. Researcher Stan. The remote arm poured the mix into a glass of water. Drink mix was shown to be colored bright red. Upon fully diffusing into the water, it began to violently react and created a small explosion, destroying the glass and sending shards throughout the room. Remote arm and drink pouch were unharmed.

Note: I was expecting something more grenade-like, but it was awesome anyway. We got permission to break open to pouch over a 20-liter tub. -Stan

Results: Remote arm was used to crush the pouch, spilling most of its contents into the tub. After roughly five minutes, the water in the tub began to react, bubbling and spilling its contents, making loud gurgling noises. A loud bang is audible as the camera feed cuts out. Later inspection shows the camera was destroyed when a piece of the tub impacted it and broke it open, allowing water to damage the circuitry. The remote arm was also destroyed by a mixture of blunt force damage, shrapnel, and water.

Note: Anybody got some clean pants I can borrow? -Stan

Note: Yes, we all know how to make amnestics, 914. -Researcher Calloway

Input: 1 vial of aerosol amnestic solution.
Setting: Fine
Output: A colorless, odorless gas. Detection methods proved unable to detect the gas, so the chamber was declared empty, and several researchers, including Calloway, were affected. The gas proved to be anomalous, with the effect of making all subjects who inhale it speak and write backwards for an unknown length of time.

Note: .sruoh flah a dna eerht rof siht ekil kcuts neeb ev'I ,em pleh enoemoS -Researcher Calloway

Note: We're going to let him sit this one out for the duration of the effect to allow him to ponder the question: Is testing of mind-affecting substances through unpredictable anomalous objects a good idea? No one tell him the answer; he'll have to come up with it on his own. - Dr. Veritas.

Note: This test is to see if SCP-914 can fall for the same "Tricks" as we can - Darby

Input: One Di-Hydrogen Monoxide Pamphlet
Setting: Fine
Output: One Pamphlet describing the dangers of Pollution

Note: The Bucket of water was carried in a sealed container by four men in haz-mat suits as if it was an incredibly dangerous liquid - Darby

Input: One 2-Liter Tub of "Di-Hydrogen Monoxide"
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One 2-Liter Tub of Di-Hydrogen Monoxide
It did nothing? I was expecting it to super heat it or destroy it in some way, well, better deal with this water and dispose of it properly - Researcher Darby

Site-19 has been put into Quarantine until the "Di-Hydrogen Monoxide" can be flushed out of the drainage system and affected areas. SCP-914 apparently turned the bucket of water into a bucket of Di-Hydrogen Monoxide, this change was only detected when Researcher Darby was put into the medical bay approximately two hours after drinking from the bucket. All reported claims of Di-Hydrogen monoxide as stated by the pamphlet are revealed to be the case as reported by medical staffs examination of the researcher.

Note: Please, please, test everything that comes out of 914 if it looks unchanged. This was quite annoying to deal with. - Dr. Range - Site 19 Medical Department

Note: He actually drank from the ██████ bucket? I'm signing a disclaimer right now, not to be the one responsible for cleaning up his corpse when the idiot inevitably gets himself killed. - Dr. Veritas

Test 914-0434

Output: One Foundation standard computer keyboard. Wired, white plastic, Russian labeling.

Note: Output confirmed to be identical to the keyboards used at Russian Foundation sites.

Input: One Foundation standard computer keyboard
Setting: 1:1
Output: A plastic device, 10 by 10 by 3 centimeters in size. The device connects to computers with a USB-A cable, and is recognized as an input device. The top of the device has two dials, a 6 cm by 6 cm dot matrix screen, and a number of buttons labelled ひ, カ, 漢, R, ゛, ゜,。 and 入. The device is capable of storing and displaying sequences of up to 16 symbols, inputting them into the computer (and clearing them from its memory) upon pressing the 入 button.
The device is identical to the input devices retrieved from universe 12N-U677-22F by SCP-507. This is a useful baseline. Now let's see what it improves!

Input: One Foundation standard computer keyboard
Setting: Fine
Output: One "digital accordion". The bellow is rubber, and the instrument has no acoustic components. There is a USB-B port on the left hand side.

Note: When connected to a computer, it functions as a MIDI input device. Item can be requested from Site-19 electronics storage.

Input: One Foundation standard computer keyboard
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One pair of gloves, one pair of contact lens, a pile of plastic and metal scraps, one USB dongle. When the contact lens and the gloves are worn, the user sees a virtual keyboard projected in front of them, just below the heels of their palm. Typing on this keyboard provides haptic feedback through the gloves. If the dongle is connected to a computer, the keyboard functions as a standard USB keyboard - additionally, it is capable of Bluetooth connection.

Note: Remanded to the reverse engineering division for potential future monetization. No, you can't have it. The Foundation has fairly strict policies regarding wireless input devices.

Input: One Foundation standard computer keyboard
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One plastic woodpecker figurine. When placed near a computer keyboard, it becomes animate and begins transcribing human speech above 5 decibels.

Note: Unfortunately, it makes a typo in every tenth word or so, making it nothing more than a novelty item. - Gregorius

Name: Dr. Artium
Date: 21/02/2019
Total Items: One copy of the game "Team Fortress 2", One "Scout Picture", One aluminum can filled with drink mix

With multiple video game related tests conducted with 914 I thought that I would test results with this game due to the high number of random objects that appear in the game, this may help determine what 914 would determine as worthy of "fine" and "very fine". -Artium

Input: All of the above items
Setting: very fine
Output: One full can of "Bonk Atomic Punch". D-Class personnel performed a test to review if it had the same effect as in-game ''Atomic Punch''. After a single sip, D-41241-WA immediately grabbed their chest in pain and collapsed. On conduction of an autopsy medical staff confirmed the cause of death to be a heart attack, along with toxic amounts of plastic and wood pulp forming in the stomach and liver, presumably the remains of the game and the picture.

Note: It appears that the drinks total amount of sugar conformed to reality so instead of making a person able to move impossible speeds their heart rate elevated impossible speeds. -Artium.

Test 914-0439
Name: Jr. Researcher Stan
Date: 21/02/2019
Total Items: One box of various Nerf brand foam and rubber darts.

Input: Box of darts
Setting: Fine
Output: Pile of modified darts. The rubber tips appear to have been melted and hardened into slugs fitted into foam casings. The bottoms of the casings are designed to compress air going in and launch the slugs at high speed. The amount of rubber needed to create a slug that fit the casings appears to have been borrowed from other darts, as there were fewer output darts than input and a small pile of foam was found in the output chamber. Slugs cannot be refit into their respective casings after being fired.

Note: They fit into standard Nerf blasters and magazines, but there isn't any way to eject spent shells, meaning that you can only use one dart. They work best with the blasters that use revolving barrels to contain darts. Did I mention that they sting really bad? - Stan

Note: Nerf wars are prohibited on site grounds, no matter how "fun they are." - Dr. Veritas

Input: 1 iron bar, 1 circle drawn on A4 paper.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 iron plate, with an anomalous symbol drawn on it. When viewed, it produces instant headaches, and forces all personnel to tell their view of the truth for an unknown period of time. The paper is suspected to be inside of the plate.

Note: Seriously?! Screw you, 914! I hate my job! As a [REDACTED], I should be offered more than this! Honestly, I work with [REDACTED], for crying out loud! This is ridicu- -Sr. Researcher Calloway

Note: Sr. Researcher Calloway was apprehended before he could inadvertently release any more confidential information in front of Class-D personnel. He will remain in a holding room until such a time as the anomaly wears off. He's also temporarily suspended for calling Dr. Veritas a despotic ██████████ and suggesting where he can put his security manual. - Sergeant Richard Hammer

Note: This seems pretty normal, maybe a different setting will produce something of a more anomalous nature. - Dr. Spoonmaker

Input: The Novel
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An approximately 24cm high Tripod figure made entirely out of the materials of the novel walked out of SCP-914's output area and proceeded to fire paper darts at anyone in its vicinity. Dr. Spoon and one other Researcher only received minor paper cuts before the paper tripod was shot by one of the guards present in the testing chamber; investigation on the remains of the Tripod revealed several intricate mechanisms which no-one in Site-█ knew what to make of.

Note: Research of the paper Tripod is ongoing, however it is likely to be dropped eventually but overall it was interesting to see how 914 reacted when processing the book. - Dr. Spoonmaker

D-914-5 is seen pulling the trigger before the camera feed cut out. The interior of the soundproof room had sustained major structural damage and D-914-5 appeared to have been crushed against the far wall by the percussive force. The device appears to have destroyed itself upon being fired.

Note: I felt that shockwave from the camera room in a whole other area of the site. When we got there, the D-class was a fine mist on the walls. - Stan

Date: 06/03/2019
Total Items: N/A

Input: Researcher Syeda
Setting: Fine
Output: A humanoid entity that has properties similar to that of a puppet. The knees and elbows resemble round, bulbous spheroids constructed out of a flesh/[REDACTED] concentrate. The forearm is capable of moving around these bulbs using specific placement of cartilage and thigh tissue. The subject's mouth resembles that of a "nutcracker", capable of moving up and down when stimulus is applied to the subject's stomach area. A steady stream of saliva consistently exits this mouth. Before expiring, the subject vocalized "and all the players a stage" to 5 nearby security guards that were attempting to neutralize it.

I heard those words. I heard them clearly. I wasn't there, but I heard them. It looked like a puppet, because it was. I was in the other room, hearing the rusted gears of 914. I heard that thing. It has a point, you know? Me and my other coworkers agree. Syeda won't be forgotten. -Dr. Alex

Date: 06/03/2019
Total Items: 1 ██████ brand bicycle helmet

Input: Helmet
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Visually unchanged bicycle helmet, with the exception of the brand name missing from back. When worn by a D-Class Personnel, the helmet appeared to release spikes into his head, causing excruciating pain. Subject did not expire, however.

Name: Jr. Researcher Stan
Date: 07/03/2019
Total Items: One 2 kg block of sculpting clay

Input: As stated above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Beehive sculpted out of clay. When disturbed, several clay honeybees flew out of multiple hidden holes on the hive's surface. They appear to have been flying through anomalous means. The bees were unable to sting any of the personnel present due to the softness of their material, but they were able to fly into them at high speeds. This tactic would cause the bees to destroy themselves, but left large welts on the personnel's skin. The beehive was eventually destroyed by security. Analysis showed that the structure of the hive was a complex series of tunnels and empty honeycombs.

Note: It felt like I was playing naked paintball against a firing squad. - Stan

Input: Four "draw four" cards, the "draw five" from the previous output.
Setting: 1:1
Output: Five cards from the card game Yu-Gi-Oh!, each card making up part of "Exodia the forbidden one."

Total Items: One Blu-ray copy of the full series of Twilight, one printed copy of the "My Immortal" fanfiction

Input: Blu-ray disk containing all Twilight movies.
Setting: Fine
Output: A blu-ray disk containing the entire Underworld series. Upon further examination, a note within the case of said disk reading "NO" was found, in the place of a printed digital download code.

Note: Me too, 914. Me too. -Dr. Viridine

Input: Printed copy of "My Immortal" fanfiction.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A hardcover copy of a book titled simply "HOW TO WRITE". Pages completely blank. Experimentation revealed that if a reader viewed each page within the book, they were suddenly compelled to write. Several D-Class subjects were instructed to read the book, and each produced within several hours a full draft of a fictional story with an incredibly detailed plot. Permission of further research on book and possible classification as an anomaly of its own requested.

Note: I think even 914 is disgusted by that fic. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a completed manuscript to email to my publisher. -Dr. Viridine

Note: I'm not sure what 914 is trying to say here. Maybe we should brush it up on some American history. -Dr. Leopold

Input: 1 American history textbook
Setting: Fine
Output: A book on the topic of slavery, war, and violence throughout the world's history.

Note: Okay, I didn't think that 914 would bring up that kind of political history but here we are. -Dr. Leopold

Note: I don't actually think it intentionally brings this up. From my experience (which is substantial), it's not actually clear if 914 is sapient or that it's more like an A.I. that makes assumptions based on information given to it, without really understanding what it's saying on a conceptual level. Then again, it loves taking the piss out of Calloway, so who knows. - Veritas

Upon reaching the final image, several instances of SCP-1471-1 are seen, seemingly arguing with each other. Exposure to the final image causes the subject to immediately contract the final stage of SCP-1471.

Input: 1 phone, Dr. Amastov
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 smartphone, with SCP-1471 installed, along with Dr. Amasov's corpse. All instances of SCP-1471-1 are replaced with Dr. Amastov. Upon viewing the images, the usual anomalous properties are noted, with SCP-1471-1 being replaced by Dr. Amastov. Class-D testing has shown that Dr. Amastov retained his sentience, and is able to converse with affected personnel.

While active, it changed the formatting of several files, as well as edited certain words. Said edited words usually involve the word "virus". Virus was contained to it's 914 experiment log, and not deleted for testing purposes.

Note: This was absolutely not my fault, because I followed security measures virus using a disconnected testing computer. So uh… don't Virus me please. -Johnny

Yeah, you disconnected the computer but left the wireless network utilities and hardware intact before you plugged the infected and potentially (it was potential then, a fact now) anomalous compact flash drive in. I'm not sure what punishment I'm going to recommend to Dr. Veritas, but it'll be something that takes as long as the time I'm going to have to put into hunting down and restoring all the infected database entries. Maybe a mandatory course on proper virus protocols, we can go all the way back to Elk Cloner and work from there. Thanks for the extra work, buddy.

Test 914-0475
RaISA Notice: The following test was recorded before the Foundation's modern record keeping, as such it may not represent current documentation protocol. Furthermore it did not occur after the test listed before it.

It has come to my attention that personnel frequently submit proposals to use naturally occurring phenomenon in SCP-914. SCP-914 modifies (not improves) objects based around their current state and the "purpose", ergo assuming there isn't a creator deity or similar; a rock should be null in purpose. While the curiosity and creative application of an SCP item is admirable, it has become annoying for all parties involved. For this reason I'm attaching the one time that was attempted and why we won't ever try it again. You'd better be grateful for this; I had to go into some dark bowls of Site-19's archive to get these. I'm still not sure I was the only thing down there.

- Dr. L. E. Veritas, head of SCP-914 documentation.

Name: Dr. Langford
Date: 03/05/1926
Total Items: Several small stones.

Input: One of the aforementioned stones.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A different stone of the same weight.

Input: One of the aforementioned stones.
Setting: Fine
Output: A mass of molten rock, it seems to have super-heated the air in the chamber to explosive levels. The damage to SCP-914 was minimal and could be repaired by conventional means. The assisting staff are currently recovering from burns in the [REDACTED] hospital. Dr. Langford was unaffected due to his distance from the test.
Update (20/03/1926): The burned staff have begun to show symptoms inconsistent with burns, possibly abnormal in nature. These symptoms include a general poorly defined sickness (nausea, weakness, headaches, etc) and most notably a loss of hair. The medical ward is presently closed off from the rest of the facility.
Update:Update (22/03/1926) Following progression of the aforementioned symptoms, the staff have died. Attending medical staff are not showing symptoms. Classification of the corpses as an SCP item is being considered.
Update (06/08/1945): The symptoms noted in the staff have been discovered occurring en-masse under mundane circumstances and is no longer considered to be an abnormality. The bodies have been given a proper burial.

Test 914-0476

Output: An unlabeled book containing scripts for every episode of Star Trek, a propaganda project launched by the Foundation to spread misotheistic and pro-scientific ideals under the cover of a science-fiction franchise.

Input: One of the aforementioned books.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A colony of small animate humanoids made out of paper and ink who worshiped the attending staff as their "creators". After six hours the entire population was destroyed in a religious war. Notably, like all items output by SCP-914, their memory was limited to seconds after the "Output" booth was opened.

Input: 1 Mech Blueprint, 1 Ton of Steel, 1 AI Cores
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 Steel Cube with Paper accents, (AI Core implanted inside)

Note: Scrapping this, you can't even use the AI as it has no outlet. - Darby

Input: 1 Mech Blueprint, 1 Ton of Steel, 1 AI Cores
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 Unarmed Automatic Mech

Note: Once I finish this next test I'll send it to MTF Command to be used containing anomalous objects. - Darby

Note: Yeah, they're not exactly subtle. If we were to use these, we're limited to using them only in Transformer cosplay events. - MTF Captain Niles.

Input: Box of Chocolates
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Miniature feminine humanoid produced entirely from chocolate.

Addendum: Upon output booth opening, Object rushed at Researcher Darby and proceeded to feed him chocolate until he fainted from inability to breath through the chocolate. Then the Object avoided Security Personnel attempts to contain it and accessed the Mech from the previous test, which it used to enact a massive Containment Breach until MTF forces took it down with a AT weapon. Researcher Darby is in ICU due to Medical Personnel taking longer to reach him due to Containment Breach.

Date: 21/03/2019
Total Items: Three #2 Pencils, not sharpened.

Pre-Test Note: The dial of the machine was removed during the test.

Input: One #2 Pencil
Setting: N/A
Output: One #1 Pencil, sharpened

Input: One #2 Pencil
Setting: N/A
Output: One broken pencil, with various cuts and bite marks around it

Input: One #2 Pencil
Setting: N/A
Output: One #14 Pencil. When held, it seems to write whatever the holder is thinking.

Note: It looks like the output is completely random, as if a setting was chosen. The settings it seemed to choose were 1:1, Rough or Coarse, then Fine or Very Fine, in that order. Dial returned to 914 after the test. -Dr. Blane

Note: 3 HOURS POST-TEST: The #14 pencil from test 3 is gone, replaced by a #2 pencil with the words "Veritas" written on it. So if it was swapped with one of his pencils, uh… sorry? -Dr. Blane

Note: Thanks for the heads-up, but I'm not enough of a megalomaniac to have custom pencils made with my name on it. I'd also like to know who gave you permission to remove the dial panel. - Veritas

Test 914-0480
Name: Dr. Lucius Veritas
Date: 22/03/2019
Total Items: Three office lamps

Note: I'm running a test to see if 914 is still functioning properly (relatively speaking) after the removal of the panel, which has been reattached.

Input: One office lamp
Setting: Coarse
Output: A disassembled office lamp, with the components sorted based on size.

Input: One office lamp.
Setting: 1:1
Output: An office lamp, seemingly unchanged. Turned on, it appears to block light reaching the retinas of all organisms within a 5 meter radius, effectively blinding them until they move out of its range.

Note: An anti-lamp. Huh. - Veritas

Input: One office lamp.
Setting: Very fine (D-Class Personnel was employed to retrieve and test the result).
Output: One office lamp. When activated, it emits Gamma radiation. D-Class Personnel expired due to acute radiation poisoning. Notably, when the lamp was deactivated by remotely controlled drone, all traces of radiation dissipated immediately, unlike normal Gamma radiation which can linger for centuries.

Note: So, the logic behind this is that light is essentially a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with a wavelength inside the visible spectrum. Increase the frequency enough, and you get ultraviolet light, X-rays, and eventually Gamma rays. 914 seems to be functioning as well as can be expected in its state, carry on people. - Veritas

Incident Report: Researcher I. Darby was severely wounded by White Phosphorous in his attempt to force his Assistant Personnel and Security Escort out of the SCP-914 Containment Area. SCP-914 was not damaged but its Containment Area requires cleaning and minor repair, Researcher I. Darby has been returned to the ICU and has been banned from using SCP-914 until he is fully healed. - Site Manager

Note: Maybe SCP-914 is still on the Fritz after that panel got taken off - Jr. Researcher Norton

Note: Every test this guy does is a spit in Darwin's face. It's a miracle that he survived this long, I have half a mind to have him classified as an anomalous object. Someone get me a bloody aspirin. - Veritas

Name: Dr. Artium
Date: 23/03/2019
Total items: One copy of a biography on the life of "Stan Lee", one Lenovo laptop

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The laptop was wrapped in what appeared to be the pages of the book however no writing was present on any papers. Upon removing the the paper the top of the laptop seemed to be replaced with the original cover material of said book, all Lenovo logos on the laptop were replaced with the word "excelsior". On starting up the laptop researchers were met with an animated humanoid on screen who resembled the late "Stan Lee". The humanoid was able to speak and respond to questions asked of it and several questions related to the life of "Stan Lee" were answered accurately.

Note: I need to go and cry for a minute, excuse me! -Dr. Artium

Test 914-0486
Name: Maintenance Technician Johnson
Date: 23/03/2019
Total Items: 300 identical florescent light bulbs

Note: I want to see if large amounts of identical items will affect the output in any noticeable way.

Input: 100 identical florescent light bulbs
Setting: 1:1
Output: One very large florescent light bulb

Note: We don't use the model of the input lights here, so I guess this is about as useful to us. - MT Johnson

Input: 100 identical florescent light bulbs.
Setting: Fine
Output: 46 identical incandescent light bulbs filled with florescent gas. 22 of the bulbs subsequently collapsed due to the pressure differential between the gas inside and outside the bulbs.

Note: Incandescent light bulbs are supposed to have a non-reactive gas inside them, not the opposite of that. These lights are extremely inefficient, extremely bright (but not as bright as some pre-existing alternatives), and extremely short-lasting (averaging 1 hour use before burning out), effectively making them useless. I've left them in non-anomalous item storage, just in case someone thinks up a use for them. - MT Johnson

Input: 100 identical florescent light bulbs
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One floating sphere made of plastic and metal surrounded by a sphere of glowing gas. Moving the sphere with tools (as the heat produced by the object made physically touching it impossible) caused the sphere of gas to move with it. The gas remained anomalously stable during transport, remaining in a perfect sphere around the core at all times, regardless of the speed or direction of transport.

Note: This… shouldn't be working like this. Florescent bulbs work by producing UV light, which then gets converted into visible light by the glass of the bulb, so we shouldn't be seeing anything but the core. Also, how the heck is this thing producing heat and light with no input whatsoever? Then again, this was made by 914. I'm pretty sure that it's never heard of the laws of physics, or at least doesn't take them seriously. - MT Johnson

Total Items: One USB drive containing a copy of the Valve game Portal 2, One 10cmx10cm picture of MT Johnson

Note: I want to see how 914 reacts to MT Johnson again, as well as more of Valve's games. I find both to be very amusing. -Researcher Gailen

Input: Picture of MT Johnson
Setting: Fine
Output: 10cmx10cm Picture of Cave Johnson from Portal 2. Upon viewing the picture, the subject is compelled to say "Cave Johnson, we're done here." and exit the room.

Note: This hindered the test significantly as everyone would walk into the room and then back out over and over again. And I forgot about Cave Johnson there, Johnson and Johnson… -Researcher Gailen

Input: One copy of Portal 2
Setting: 1:1
Output: No change A copy of Portal 2, but the voice of and all images of Cave Johnson have been replaced by the voice of and the face of MT Johnson.

Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 note with Researcher Calloway's name, heavily decorated.

Note: Is all of this over? Can I finally have peace with this machine?

Input: 1 note with Researcher Calloway's name, heavily decorated.
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 piece of paper, with a cognitohazardous symbol drawn on it. When a subject views it, the subject immediately feels the compulsion to rhythmically bang their head on a wall.

Note: Calloway was rushed to the medical bay, and we have the thing in a box, where no one can see it. -Sergeant Richard Hammer

Note: For Christ's sake, Darby and Calloway seem to be competing to gets to be killed the fastest. I don't know what's more merciful: Ban them from testing or let natural selection take care of it. - Veritas

Setting: 1:1
Output: 2 $100 bills folded into origami tigers and a note reading "No Zoids for you!" with a caricature of someone getting slapped with a spoon.

Note: Oh, for the love of…it's "Secure. Contain. Protect," NOT "Shop. Checkout. Purchase." This is a matter reshaping machine, not eBay. The professor's clearances have been suspended pending further review. -Veritas

Maybe this thing's more a fan of Seinfeld than anime? -Former Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Test 914-0492

Input: One paper
Setting: 1:1 with the "mood" panel on Jovial original panel was replaced with the mood one after turning the dial to 1:1.
Output: A slip of paper that folded its self in to a paper airplane. It makes a whistling sound when thrown.

Note: Can I keep this one? -Intern Lunar

Input: One mug
Setting: Animal mood panel was replaced with the "attribute" one after turning the dial to a blank spot.
Output: An animate cat mug with the mouth of the mug on the cat's back. Cat seems to enjoy being filled with a liquid. This however, is a hazard if the liquid is hot, as the cat still will roll around on its back possibly ruining papers or causing burns. It also seems to enjoy knocking things off of desks as well as sleeping on keyboards.

Note: Ok, this is adorable. Can I please keep this? cxvtrsdfrvASDAD -Intern Lunar

Note: Lunar, You're clearly new here if you think that keeping anomalous objects is a good idea. Keep them, but I'm not responsible for what happens to you because of it. Don't use it after midnight, as a precaution. -Veritas

Update: It eats and excretes. I need a litter box. Also I'm the intern, so thanks for telling me. -Intern Lunar

Note: Who let an intern use 914 without supervision? Also, Why do we have interns in the first place? - Researcher Darby

Note: My supervisor let me. Also I would assume so they can see if I should be hired? - Intern Lunar

Date: 28/03/2019
Total Items: Five plastic Lego bricks
Note: I'm sure we all know what's going to happen if we use the new "malicious" option. What I want to know is if the option selected before adding the new panel impacts the result. For all of these tests, the original panel was turned to a setting, removed, and replaced with the mood panel, which was then set to malicious. - Dr. Sheath

Input: One plastic Lego brick
Setting of original panel: Rough
Setting of mood panel: Malicious
Output: One plastic Lego brick which shattered into fragments upon being picked up.

Input: One plastic Lego brick
Setting of original panel: Fine
Setting of mood panel: Malicious
Output: One plastic Lego brick, now possessing an anomalous property wherein, if a person is walking within 25 meters of it with no footwear on, it will automatically transport itself to a spot under their foot.

Note: …Oh dear. I was expecting that to be the Very Fine result. Now I'm scared… - Dr. Sheath

Input: One plastic Lego brick
Setting of original panel: Very Fine
Setting of mood panel: Malicious
Output: One plastic Lego brick. When coming into contact with any surface, studs in the style of Lego bricks appear on that surface within three seconds of contact. Dr. Sheath was sent to the medical bay after the aforementioned studs appeared on his hand after picking it up. The Lego brick has been sent to anomalous item storage.

Note: It doesn't hurt or anything, and it hasn't spread beyond my hand, but it hasn't gone away yet. I could probably live with it, but it'd be really inconvenient… - Dr. Sheath

Setting: Fine
Output: An edited copy of SCP-096's file. An extra addendum has been added to the bottom of the page. Said addendum details multiple containment breaches of SCP-096.

Input: One copy of SCP-096's file
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An edited copy of SCP-096's file. The words on the page have been jumbled in order to create an accurate visual of SCP-096's face. Viewing this recreation of its face results in no anomalous effects.

Note: This is actually pretty tame for things 914 has done in the past. I might hang this on my wall. - Dr.Piedmont

Note: I'm putting 5 dollars on this man not lasting a week, he just seems to have that special relationship with 914 that me and Calloway share - Researcher Darby

Note: I like those odds, I'll put another 5 on top of that. - Dr. Piedmont

Test 914-0497
Name: Guest Researcher Prof. Wren
Date: 30/03/2019
Total Items: One piece of 8.5"x11" paper, one mechanical pencil with 0.3mm lead

Note: The professor's clearances were reinstated after remedial training on 914's functionality.

Note: Okay, first off, my bad about last time. Anyway, I've heard that this device isn't sentient, but from the test records involving Darby and Calloway alone, I'm fairly sure it has a sense of humor…and quite possibly a vendetta. Let's test that first one out. - Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Input: A note card reading "Know any good jokes?"
Setting: 1:1
Output: A note card reading "Knock knock."

Note: Huh. Gotta be honest, I was half expecting it to be something insulting. Well, let's roll with it, see how this plays out. - Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Input: The same note card, with the previous note erased. It now reads "Who's there?"
Setting: 1:1
Output: A note card reading "Peak hatch."

Note: Peak ha—oh good grief. I think I can already tell where this is going. -Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Input: A note card reading "Peak hatch who?"
Setting: 1:1
Output: The note card is now folded into the shape of a rodent-like creature, confirmed to be the mascot of the Pokémon franchise. Upon the creature's name being uttered, the sound of 2 snare drums and a cymbal were heard from an unknown location.

Note: Well, I suppose the test was only to see IF 914 had a sense of humor, not how GOOD of one it had. Maybe if I'd given it the whole pencil it could have written out something better? -Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Test 914-0498
Name: Dr. Piedmont
Date: 31/03/2019
Total Items: One image of SCP-173, a sharpie

Note: We haven't seen how SCP-914's new "mood" settings affects images yet. My prediction is that it will be more-or-less the same as usual, but you never know with 914. -Dr. Piedmont

Input: One image of SCP-173, a sharpie
Setting: Very Fine
Mood Setting: Jovial
Output: An image of SCP-173 with a handlebar mustache and a top hat drawn onto his head and a slightly used sharpie.

Note: I wonder how far we can take this -Dr. Piedmont

Input: The above result
Setting: Very Fine
Mood Setting: Jovial
Output: An edit of the above image. SCP-173 now has a monocle and a crudely drawn cane next to its "hand". An even more used sharpie

Input: The above result
Setting: Very Fine
Mood Setting: Jovial
Output: An edit of the above image. The background of the image is now a fancy party drawn with a sharpie, with multiple other SCPs in the background dressed the same way SCP-173 is. A sharpie that is out of ink.

Note: It was later discovered that an image of SCP-096 drawn in sharpie was on the back of the photo. Analysis into why SCP-914 drew this when the image was of SCP-173 is ongoing. I am currently not liking the odds that Researcher Darby gave me. -Dr. Piedmont

Note: Well, if you last a week I'll throw you a cupcake party, and 10 dollars for winning the bet. Also, can I have this picture? I find it highly amusing - Researcher Darby

Note: I highly doubt I'll last the week, but you can have the photo. - Dr. Piedmont

Test 914-0499
Name: Dr. Harper
Date: 01/04/2019
Total Items: Twenty standard stainless steel ball-peen hammers with oak wood handles

Note: The purpose of these tests is to properly catalogue the possibilities that the
recently manufactured extra panels might offer. Authorization for an exemption to the
ban on biological testing pending, I've opted not to pursue the Animal and Vegetable
settings, or the remaining Mineral setting for that matter. - Dr. Harper

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Rough
Mood setting: Curious
Output: A ball-peen hammer, sliced into neat 2cm thick portions, arranged into a neat semicircle.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Coarse
Mood Setting: Curious
Output: A scraped and battered ball-peen hammer, inscribed with obscure sentences and pictograms. Analysis on their possible meaning is ongoing, though low-priority.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: 1:1
Mood Setting: Curious
Output: An irregularly-shaped ball-peen hammer with a stainless steel handle and a wooden head.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Fine
Mood Setting: Curious
Output: A music box composed of oak and stainless steel which plays the hook of "U Can't Touch This" by MC Hammer.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Very Fine
Mood Setting: Curious
Output: A small war hammer adorned with Nordic runes. When held by a human, the holder is possessed by an entity calling itself 'Asmund', claiming to be a deceased viking warrior. Entity is mostly non-hostile, and will primarily recount glorified tales of its supposed exploits. Removing item reverts its holder to their normal state of mind.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Rough
Mood Setting: Malicious
Output: Ashes and molten steel. Molten steel proved excessively difficult to remove - ultimately requiring the entire output booth floor to be replaced.

Note: Usually 914 resorts to scare tactics or physical harm. Toil is an entirely other
echelon of malice, I'd say. - Dr. Harper

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Coarse
Mood Setting: Malicious
Output: Item appeared unchanged. A D-class was instructed to retrieve it. Upon touch, the item collapsed seemingly into dust. Testing has determined that breathing the dust will cause an allergic reaction in which an itchy rash will form whenever the recipient is in physical contact with hammers.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: 1:1
Mood Setting: Malicious
Output: A hammer which had been stretched to a length of 4 meters and 22 centimeters, fitting into the output chamber from corner to corner. Item was broken in two in order to retrieve it. Item weighs exactly the same as the original hammer.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Fine
Mood Setting: Malicious
Output: A hammer which switches places with whatever item it hits. No upper limit to the weight or dimensions of such objects has been found.

Note: This is a major containment issue. When in contact with any matter, it counts
even tiny vibrations as "hitting", eventually wriggling out of piles of sand and even
jelly. Currently our best bet at containment is to suspend it in mid-air magnetically. I
shudder to think what would happen if this thing ever touched bedrock. - Dr. Harper

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Very Fine
Mood Setting: Malicious
Output: A hammer that did not initially display any deviations from the input item. Testing was at first inconclusive. After 24 hours of disuse, the item duplicated itself. Further testing has confirmed that the item duplicates itself whenever it isn't used at least once in any given 24 hour period, with all copies retaining the anomalous properties. All resulting hammers successfully contained.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Rough
Mood Setting: Insightful
Output: A ball-peen hammer broken in two. Analysis suggests item was broken by stress from overuse.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Coarse
Mood Setting: Insightful
Output: Irregular wooden tubes aligning to the tree rings found on the original hammer. Two irregular metal objects, one pure iron and the other pure chromium. Analysis suggests that the metals are arranged in the shape in which they were originally contained as ores.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: 1:1
Mood Setting: Insightful
Output: A small device with a stainless steel outer shell and three buttons. Each button corresponds to a single wooden slab which protrudes out from the top of the machine via a simple non-anomalous mechanism. The slabs read "Baa Baa", "Dolly" and "Shaun" respectively. On the bottom of the machine is an inscription stating that the machine is "A lamb-name helper".

Note: Upon mentioning the seemingly non-sequitur object to Researcher Jaynim of the linguistics department, she informed me that "A lamb-name helper" is an anagram of "A ball-peen hammer". - Dr. Harper

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Fine
Mood Setting: Insightful
Output: A miniature shoemaking toolkit missing its hammer.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Very Fine
Mood Setting: Insightful
Output: A hammer which changes appearance upon being picked up. Investigation revealed that the form taken often signifies great nostalgia to the holder. Physical attributes remain unchanged even when appearance is altered.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Rough
Mood Setting: Jovial
Output: A small 50 piece puzzle depicting the collective outputs from the previous fifteen tests, with the addition of four unidentified objects.

Note: If I know anything about 914, those four extra items will be the resulting
items from the last four tests I've scheduled. - Dr. Harper

Note: Having completed the tests, I can confirm this to be true. - Dr. Harper

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Coarse
Mood Setting: Jovial
Output: A ball-peen hammer with a loosened head. Upon originally being picked up from the output booth, the head came off and struck the personnel on their foot, causing slight amusement to other personnel at present. Hammer and its components found to be non-anomalous.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: 1:1
Mood Setting: Jovial
Output: Twenty miniature hammers placed in a display case, equal in total weight to the original input. While comprised of the same raw materials, each miniature hammer is unique in design.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Fine
Mood Setting: Jovial
Output: A hammer inscribed with the phrase "Whistle while you work". Using the hammer to perform any kind of physical work causes a mild compulsion to whistle or hum while doing so.

Input: One Ball-peen hammer
Setting: Very Fine
Mood Setting: Jovial
Output: A hammer which grows or shrinks to accommodate the minimum constraining volume. Can be easily shrunk in size by applying any amount of force to opposing sides. A sound akin to a slide whistle can be heard whenever the item changes size.

Note: I hope that this had any kind of research merit. If anybody can convince the higher-ups to test with the other control panel, be my guest. - Dr. Harper

Test 914-0500
Name: Dr. Piedmont
Date: 01/04/2019
Total Items: One handwritten note, a pencil

Input: A note with the words "April Fools" on it, a pencil
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The above note, written on the back are multiple ways to prank other members of the staff, the methods of doing it are separated into anomalous and non-anomalous methods, a very dull pencil is laid down next to the note.

Note: An actual good one for once, wow. Definitely keeping this. - Dr. Piedmont

Note: If you prank me, there will be no cookies if you last the week - Researcher Darby

Note: Don't even think about it. - Veritas

Test 914-0501
Name: Researcher Lombardi
Date: 02/04/2019
Total Items: Three stainless steel spoons.

Input: One stainless steel spoon.
Setting: 1:1
Mood Panel Setting: Curious
Output: One stainless steel spork.

Input: One stainless steel spoon.
Setting: 1:1
Mood Panel Setting: Insightful
Output: One stainless steel spoon. The reflection viewed on the interior of the spoon appears sideways, rather than upside-down. Under analysis, it has been determined this is due to a thin layer of metal being arranged in a manner that causes it to act as a meta-material.

Note: The spork was expected. This on the other hand seems too advanced for an equivalent exchange. I'm feeling less confident that the initial panel setting is being observed. -Researcher Lombardi

Input: One stainless steel spoon.
Setting: 1:1
Mood Panel Setting: Malicious

Note:
Reading the log below has potential to change your expectation of 914's behavior in a dangerous fashion. At this point, we're not sure what the risk factor actually is. We're not redacting this yet because it's a useful data point to track. Skip the log or schedule an amnestic treatment if you don't want to risk it. An automated system is keeping track of everyone who doesn't - we'll be instituting stricter security measures for those individuals.

Output:
One spoon, unchanged. Microbes present in the air of the testing chamber were refined into a fast-acting and highly effective flesh-eating virus, killing the Research Assistant retrieving the spoon. Two others were injured and are now quarantined in ICU, including Researcher Lombardi. Hazmat was required to attend to the injured, along with sanitizing the area and device.

Note:
A few observations from my hospital bed - 914 has been doing us a huge favor. It could have done this during any high-level refinement, and hasn't. Unfortunately, this test-result is also poisoning the well, so to speak. We know that it is at least influenced by the knowledge and expectations of its operator, and anyone who witnessed that experiment or is even reading this log is now at risk of repeating that result. I've been informed any survivors, including myself, are going to have to undergo amnestic treatment before being cleared to experiment with 914 again. I wonder how they're going to explain my missing arm to me? - Researcher Lombardi

Note: Testing with alternative dials has been suspended. The mood panel was returned to 'curious' setting before being removed and destroyed. A malicious setting is just a bad idea, folks.

Note: Wouldn't it be a good idea to sterilize 914 before every test from now on? -Researcher Luke

Test 914-0502
Name: Researcher Luke
Date: 02/04/2019
Total Items: Three copies of "The Communist Manifesto" written by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels.

Input: One of the books mentioned above.
Setting: 1:1
Output: "Mein Kampf" written by Adolf Hitler.

Note: I don't know if 914 is cracking a joke here or comparing communism to fascism. -Luke

Input: One of the books mentioned above.
Setting: Fine
Output: A paper bust depicting Karl Marx. The bust possesses high levels of detail and it's "hair" is made from leather. It has no anomalous effects.

Input: One of the books mentioned above.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The book appeared. But when a researcher attempted to retrieve the book, said researcher complained about a sudden and sharp increase in hunger. The researcher collapsed 5 seconds after through starvation. The book's anomalous effects disappeared after it was set on fire at a distance.

Note: Don't worry, Researcher Jimmy made a recovery, however he's out of business for a while. Looks like 914 isn't a big fan of communism. - R. Luke

Note: No, Luke, you don't understand. That machine is chaotic. It doesn't have ideologies, it has results. Those are based on what it understands the input material to be. It improves, but it doesn't. It might help, but it might also kill you. 914 isn't sentient as far as we understand it, and it doesn't think like we do. Anthropomorphising the machine like that is like saying that lightning struck your grandma because Zeus didn't like her hat. - Veritas

Note: Alright, I understand. However, it's still interesting to know how 914 "knows" how things work or "knows" things related to the input-object. I'm a new researcher, so pardon my mistake. - R. Luke

Test 914-0503
Name: Researcher Luke
Date: 02/04/2019
Total Items: Three common commercially-available toasters.

Input: One toaster.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One waffle iron.

Input: One toaster.
Setting: Fine
Output: The toasters settings were replaced by three options: "Toast", "Burn", "Incinerate". The "Toast"-option toasts all kinds of bread almost instantly. The "Burn"-option makes the bread black and hard; making it inedible. The "Incinerate"-option ejects a pile of ash when bread is inserted and the toaster is activated.

Note: I requested the toaster to be added to the on-site break room. -R. Luke

Input: One toaster.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The toaster seems unchanged; however when it was picked up by a researcher the toaster began cursing at the researcher and exclaimed that he "wants to take over the world" and that he will "kill us all with toasted bread!". While it was being carried out, the toaster raised his temperature to an unknown level and burned the hands of Researcher Luke. A guard returned with heat-resistant gloves and moved the toaster into a container. During the procedure, the toaster attempted to whip the guard with it's cable; but was unsuccessful because the guard wore protective armor. The toaster was moved to on-site anomalous objects containment.

Note: I'm alright, the burns weren't severe and the doc greenlit me to get back to work. Screw that toaster though. -R. Luke

Test 914-0504
Name: Dr. Piedmont
Date: 02/04/2019
Total Items: One pencil, a handheld pencil sharpener, and a handwritten note

Input: One note reading "How to neutralize SCP-2317"
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A note, multiple sentences are transcribed on it in multiple languages, many are either crossed out or erased. The ones that aren't have been written either very sloppily or very lightly. Multiple pencil shavings, a broken pencil, and a broken handheld pencil sharpener are next to the note

Note: Okay then, that does not help. However, if the rest of the week goes like it has the past two days, I'm going to get that cupcake party - Dr. Piedmont

Test 914-0505
Name: Guest Researcher Prof. Wren
Date: 03/04/2019
Total Items: One "Stuva" loft bed manufactured by IKEA (unassembled and still in box)

Note: We've seen this machine work miracles in the past. -Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Input: The aforementioned box with all proper contents inside.
Setting: Fine

Note: For about 14 minutes after I turned the key, nothing happened. I'm pretty sure I heard lots of clanging and banging from in there, though. -Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Output: A heavily damaged cardboard box, multiple furniture pieces assembled in a shape vaguely resembling a giraffe with others strewn around the floor, [REDACTED] origami throwing stars later determined to be made from the assembly instructions. The paper stars were clocked exiting the "Output" booth for a duration of 48 seconds at speeds of up to 526 kilometers per hour and struck Prof. Wren in multiple locations, including multiple strikes to the face and groin. No serious injuries were reported.

Yeah, can't blame you there, 914. Gotta say, though, the origami game is definitely on point. Pun fully intended. -Guest Researcher Prof. Wren.

Note: A copy of the security footage has been made available with the professor's permission for anyone who wishes to view it.

Test 914-0506
Name: Dr. Piedmont
Date: 03/04/2019
Total Items: Two paper copies of the SCP-914 test logs

Input: One paper copy of the SCP-914 test logs
Setting: 1:1
Output: One paper copy of the SCP-682 termination experiment logs

Note: Not necessarily surprised by that outcome. - Dr. Piedmont

Input: One paper copy of the SCP-914 test logs
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An edited version of the SCP-914 test logs, whenever a test that involves Dr. Piedmont appears, the outcome of the test is changed to him getting heavily injured, or in one instance, killed.

Note: I take it all back, definitely testing items that most likely won't be dangerous for the rest of the week. Seriously, all I want are cupcakes. - Dr. Piedmont

Test 914-0507
Name: Guest Researcher Prof. Wren
Date: 03/04/2019
Total Items: One ream of A4 printer paper

Note: I've been noticing a theme with certain researchers and 914. Calloway gets trolled, Darby gets repeated brushes with death, and I get nicely folded paper. ~Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Input: Three sheets of paper
Setting: Coarse
Output: A pile of wood pulp, total mass consistent with the input.

First time I've ever used a setting other than 1:1. Not sure what else I expected, really.

Input: Three sheets of paper
Setting: 1:1
Output: A group of 7 origami ducks, one roughly triple the size of the other six.

Omigod that's too cute!

Input: Three sheets of paper
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One sheet of paper 840x891mm in size. When held while thinking of an object, the surface of the paper catches fire for a moment, with an image of whatever the holder was thinking of appearing on its surface. The paper automatically restores itself to its original form upon being released.

…Huh. I thought for sure it was going to fold itself into the shape of whatever I was thinking of. Guess they're right about this thing not being predictable. Still…

Input: The oversized sheet of paper from the previous experiment.
Setting: Rough
Output: A small pile of ash. Analysis indicates it is comprised of burnt paper. Total mass consistent with the mass of three pieces of A4 paper.

Sorry. I know that thing was kinda neat and that I should have gotten clearance before destroying it, but let's be real here: If someone held that while thinking about 096 or [REDACTED]…that would end poorly for them, to say the least. -Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Test 914-0508
Name: Researcher Festiv
Date: 04/04/2019
Item: One cube of frozen coolant

Input: Aforementioned cube
Setting: fine
Output: One cube of frozen coolant stuck at -126°C that can be shaped like clay, lowers the temperature of inanimate objects near it to -100°C.

Note: This could be useful. But its too cold. Food gets freezer burn, any reactors we cool it with slow the reactor down, processors that get overheated get so cold they stop working, the EXP weapons guys tried to make a cryogenic weapon with it, but ice would jam it. I'm placing this in anomalous item storage. Anyone who has a idea for a use is welcome to use it, it passed memetic tests - Researcher Festiv

Test 914-0509
Name: Dr. Nukea
Date: 04/04/2019
Total items: A signed copy of 17 again

Input: Above mentioned
Setting Fine
Output: An altered copy of 17 again which is animated instead of being live action. The signature has changed to be “STOP NUKEA”.

Note: Wow… 914 is being sassy today -Nukea

Note: Oh Christ, I thought this was over. - Veritas

- Hide 051X Test Logs
Test 914-0510
Name: Dr. Blue
Date: 04/04/2019
Total items: Several broken pens and pencils

Input: Above mentioned
Setting Fine
Output: One pen producing luminous ink, one pen producing invisible ink (visible under UV light), one ordinary pencil

Note: Sure, I guess. Needed an office clearout anyway. - Blue

Note: I'd like to clarify that 914 is not to be used as your personal trash can. - Veritas

Note: Don't complain yet, I have an idea. - Blue

Input: Luminous pen from previous test
Setting Fine
Output: One lamp, with a dial. Lamp can emit a very wide range of electromagnetic frequencies, including infrared, ultraviolet and x-rays, depending on its dial setting.

Input: Invisible ink pen from above test
Setting Fine
Output: One pen, with a dial. Ink can only be seen under a specific electromagnetic frequency, as determined by its dial setting at the time of writing.

Note: Huh. I guess it works together with the lamp. I'm wondering now if the pencil's going to fit in somehow.

Input: Pencil from above test
Setting Fine
Output: One miniature paper shredder, made out of wood with diamond blades. Appears to be functional.

Note: I guess it managed to compress the graphite down into diamond. Shall I submit this to Accounting as a potential source of funding? -Blue

Note: Absolutely not. -Veritas

Test 914-0511
Name: Jr. Researcher Stan
Date: 04/04/2019
Total Items: One wireless printer, one battery, and ten sheets of standard printing paper

Note: Printer will be plugged into battery and sent a printing order for a picture of 914 just before it is activated.

Input: Above items
Setting: 1:1
Output: Unchanged printer. Upon opening of the test chamber, the printer activated and printed a series of images that combine into a ten frame animation of Jr. Researcher Stan being attacked by a swarm of bees.

Note: More bees. Interesting and also scary. On a side note, I'm opening up a separate betting ring on when Darby will ALMOST die since no one has won any of their bets on him actually dying. To kick things off, twenty bucks says he sustains severe blunt-force trauma by the end of the month. -Stan

Test 914-0512
Name: Dr. Piedmont
Date: 04/04/2019
Total Items: Five sheets of paper

Input: One sheet of paper
Setting: Rough
Output: Multiple paper shreds, each shred is arranged from largest to smallest

Note: Even with something as simple as paper, and with one of the most predictable settings, 914 seems to put a unique spin on it still. -Dr. Piedmont

Input: One sheet of paper
Setting: Coarse
Output: Paper that has been crudely cut into multiple shapes

Input: One sheet of paper
Setting: 1:1
Output: Multiple pieces of paper that have been arranged in a format similar to that of note cards

Input: One sheet of paper
Setting: Fine
Output: One piece of folded paper, the paper is folded to resemble Dr. Piedmont

Note: This is actually kind of nice, I'm going to keep this in my room. -Dr. Piedmont

Input: One sheet of paper
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An anomalous piece of paper, upon coming into contact with said sheet of paper, the holder is compelled to make it into a type of origami. Upon completing the origami, the paper begins to fold back, no fold marks were found afterward.

Note: The paper, being anomalous and a complete nuisance, was burned from a distance. The ashes were disposed of. However, this was a very interesting testing experience and I'm looking forward to doing more similar tests. - Dr. Piedmont

THIS TEST HAS BEEN DOCTORED AND REDACTED TO KEEP THE ORIGINAL TEST CLASSIFIED.

Test 914-0513
Name: Dr. Scott.
Date: 04/04/2019
Total items: A binder containing the files of every staff member in the SCP foundation, except for the O5.

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Fine
Output: A book called “Every staff member along with their secrets.” The book details important things about researchers. Some of the pages include Dr. T███████████ has ████████ ███████████ instead of a foot or how Dr. L███████████ is actually a ████ controlling an android. It also mentioned that Dr. Scott is actually the son of █████████ and how Dr. N█████████ got his own pocket dimension by working with ███████████. Finally, it described how Dr. H█████ got into the Foundation and his counterpart Dr. H█████████ was made.

Note: I’m going to burn this. No one should ever see this period. -Dr. Scott.

Note: Dr. Scott was treated with a Class A amnestic to prevent him from accidentally spreading around classified information.

Test 914-0514
Name: Researcher Darby
Date: 05/04/2019
Total Items: 3 Miniature Napoleonic Howitzers, 3 Logs, 3 Copies of [REDACTED] paperwork

Note: This is an experiment designed to see how 914 reacts to seemingly random objects - Researcher Darby

Input: 1 Howitzer, 1 Log, 1 Copy
Setting:1:1
Output: 1 Cannon, 1 Tree trunk, 1 Memo

Note: The only thing unusual about these results were how boring they were - Researcher Darby

Input: 1 Howitzer, 1 Log, 1 Copy
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 Miniature SAM, 1 Tiny Bonsai plant, 1 set of SCP calendars

Note: Again, Boring, I'm keeping that calendar though, Veritas, want that bonsai plant? - Researcher Darby

Note: Neat. -Veritas

Input: 1 Howitzer, 1 Log, 1 Copy
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 Test Log Cannon, upon booth doors opening the cannon proceeded to wheel itself out. When Researcher Darby exited his control booth to examine the object it proceeded aim itself at Researcher Darby and fire with no discernible trigger. The projectile appeared to be a small (6cm) log of compressed SCP-914 experiment logs and it exited the barrel of the cannon at a relatively low speed for a cannon. However, the velocity was still enough to put Researcher Darby in the infirmary for severe blunt force trauma.

Note: I think I'm getting a flak vest, or maybe a suit of armor - Researcher Darby

Note: Money changing hands due to bets made on Darby's injuries can be done outside of my testing area. -Veritas

Test 914-0515
Name: Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Date: 05/04/2019
Items: Two tuning forks

Note: Acoustics is my primary research field. Thought I'd bring a bit of it with me on this test.

Input: Tuning fork, made to produce a high C-sharp when struck.
Setting: Fine
Output: A Y-shaped piece of metal resembling a trio of fish. Striking it against a surface produces the same C-sharp note as the input, but with the sound muffled similar to it being underwater.

The sound alteration is understandable, but why does it look like…oh for the love of God. 914 turned my tuning fork into a tuna fork. UGH. And I thought the "peak hatch" joke was bad! -Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Input: Tuning fork, made to produce a high E-flat when struck.
Setting: Very fine
Output: A tuning fork made out of an unknown crystalline substance. It produces a different tone when struck against various objects, with volume exponentially correlating to the force the material was struck. Further testing revealed that the tone produced seemed dependent on the material it was struck against rather than size or any other factor.

Note: Whoa. That….that could be dangerous in the wrong hands. Seriously. You guys ever seen an opera singer shatter a glass with her voice? Same principle at play here. This definitely needs to get locked away somewhere. As an aside, this is way more interesting than my regular job. You guys hiring by any chance? -Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Note: Wait, you don't work here? How did you get in? - Researcher Darby

Note: Kinda goes with the "Guest" part of the "Guest Researcher" status. I can explain more over lunch if you're interested. -Guest Researcher Prof. Wren

Note: Screw it, you can't be worse than Calloway and Darby. Welcome aboard. -Veritas

Note: What do you mean "Can't be worse than Calloway or Darby"? - Researcher Darby

Note: You know damn well what I mean. -Veritas

Test 914-0516
Name: Researcher Luke
Date: 05/04/2019
Total items: Four copies of the Duden.
Note: In case some of you don't know: The Duden is a German dictionary. -R. Luke

Input: One copy of the Duden.
Setting: Coarse
Output: The Duden, but every single word in it is misspelled in some way.

Input: One copy of the Duden.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One copy of the Österreichisches Wörterbuch.
Note: This one is an Austrian dictionary. -R. Luke

Input: One copy of the Duden.
Setting: Fine
Output: A dictionary of an unknown language resembling German.

Input: One copy of the Duden.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A copy of "Every Language Ever In One Book!". The book has the same amount of pages as the original input-book, however every 0.29% of a single page is taken up with the entire dictionary of one language. Pages are difficult to read even with a microscope. Book was moved to on-site non-anomalous objects storage.

Note: If any of you wanted to brush up on your learned languages: Here you go. -R. Luke

Test 914-0517
Name: Researcher Daniel
Date: 06/04/2019
Total Items: Three copies of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, published 2015.

Input: 1 copy of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows
Setting: Coarse
Output: A small 100 page book, titled as "Har Putar and The Dead Items". The book's plot was similar to that of Input, but was simplified and contained a lot of sarcasm and surreal humour.

Input: 1 copy of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows
Setting: Fine
Output: A book containing all of the Harry Potter novels in chronological order. Has been placed in the Site-19 breakroom on a reading stand accompanied by a microscope.

Input: 1 copy of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A brown-coloured book describing many "spells" which cause anomalous effects when uttered in the presence of it. The descriptions are highly detailed, and the book includes various sections on different kinds of spell.
Note: Why, WHY, 914 must you curse these spells to be so damn hard to pronounce? It's bad enough when you're stuck in a giant tank and have been turned into an orca just because you said a "s" instead of a "z". ~ Junior Researcher Washington

Test 914-0518
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 06/04/2019
Total Items: Three blank DVDs, 3 empty DVD cases

Note: Didn't expect the hiring process to be quite so easy! Kinda wishing he hadn't said that part about Calloway and Darby, though. Feels like a death flag might've been raised there… -Prof. Wren

Input: A blank DVD in a case
Setting: 1:1
Output: A disc-shaped piece of plastic inside of a case made of the materials used to manufacture DVDs.

Note: Okay, yeah, should've seen that coming. -Prof. Wren

Input: A blank DVD in a case
Setting: Fine
Output: A DVD and case labeled "Calloway's Calamitous Capers!" The back of the case details it as security footage of an SCP-914 experiment performed by Researcher Calloway that starts out bad and ends up turning into a "hijinx-filled escapade of love, laughter, and lasagna." The film is rated QL-37 for "violins, excessive laugh track, and graphic artichokes."

Note: What the… did it hear me mention Calloway earlier? Either way, I'm kinda scared to watch this… for all I know this could make whatever video player we put it in play Never Gonna Give You Up for the rest of eternity. -Prof. Wren

Note: I mean, that wouldn't be that bad. If you want I could give you a video player I found at a goodwill to test it with. -Intern Lunar

Note: I suppose that could work…probably best to let Calloway watch it first, though. Y'know, make sure there's nothing personal or embarrassing or otherwise best kept private. -Prof. Wren

Input: A blank DVD in a case
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A DVD case in the shape of a grenade. The case is hinged to open from the top and is locked shut with a plastic grenade pin.

Note: Okay, yeah, it definitely heard me earlier… also, definitely NOT opening this. That death flag I mentioned earlier? Not too keen on collecting it. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0519
Name: Intern Lunar
Date: 06/04/2019
Total Items: 1 Mug and a note with Dr. Nukea, Researcher Darby, Prof. Wren, and Dr. Piedmont names written on it.

Input: 1 Mug
Setting: Fine
Output: A porcelain Sippy cup. Testing shows that liquids contained with it are unable to be spilled.

Note: Can we have someone test this? I would but I'm a little scared that it might be dangerous. -Intern Lunar

Input: The note
Setting: Fine
Output: A note set partly set on fire. The name that was not burning is Prof. Wren. Once the fire burned it's self out, the remaining bit turned in to an origami cassette tape.

Note: I was going to send a picture to Prof. Wren, and it turned out to act like a QR code to an great play list. It's a mix-tape that's (from) fire. I think that tops all the bad puns we have got out of this thing. By the way, does Prof. Wren like 80s music? -Intern Lunar

Note: Absolutely, and I gotta say, this is a great collection. Can't say I recall Dee Snyder ever doing a cover of "Country Roads," though… or that it would sound so good. Weird. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0520
Name: Dr Tudor
Date: 06/04/2019
Total Items: 3 GBA Cartridges of the game: Mother 3

Input: 1 copy of Mother 3
Setting: Fine
Output: A GBA cartridge with an image of all 3 protagonists of the Mother Series. After being inserted into a Gameboy Advanced provided by Dr Bright it revealed to contain all 3 Mother games translated into many languages including unknown ones.

Note: Finally Mother 3 translated into English on the GBA. The other 2 games are a bonus. -Dr Tudor

Input: Another copy of Mother 3
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 GBA cartridge with the logo of Nintendo printed on. After inserted into a GBA it showed to have every single GBA game released on it. Some games contained were cancelled or were never released outside of a given country.

Note: I will be putting this in the break room. Nothing helps a containment breach like some Pokemon. -Dr Tudor

Test 914-0521
Name: Dr. Piedmont
Date: 06/04/2019
Total Items: Four DVD copies of the complete series of the television show 'The Office'

Input: One DVD copy of 'The Office'
Setting: Coarse
Output: One DVD copy of 'The Office', the contents of the DVD have been edited to only include when the characters Toby Flenderson, Nelly Bertram, and Gabe Lewis are on screen.

Note: This is worse than any other output that 914 has given me. I hate it. - Dr. Piedmont

Input: One DVD copy of 'The Office'
Setting: 1:1
Output: One DVD copy of the television show 'Friends'

Input: One DVD copy of 'The Office'
Setting: Fine
Output: One edited DVD copy of 'The Office', deleted scenes have been implemented into episodes where they would most make sense. Extra footage has also been added

Note: This is actually pretty good, will probably put this in the break room if Very Fine doesn't turn out too well - Dr. Piedmont

Input: One DVD copy of 'The Office'
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A DVD copy of a series that has never been recorded or aired on television. Upon putting the DVD into a player, an opening plays that is similar to the main opening of 'The Office'. All of the characters have been replaced by Foundation personnel. After the opening plays, the viewer is greeted with a season selection screen with the words 'The Foundation' near the top of the screen. Contents of said seasons appear to reflect daily happenings in the SCP Foundation that have never happened but are plausible.

Note: I am beyond words, I'd love to watch this all, but I have so much work to do. I am going to put this in the break room if anybody else wants to watch it. - Dr. Piedmont

Test 914-0522
Name: Researcher David Rosen
Date: 06/04/2019
Total Items: One Commodore Vic-20 Home Computer

Input: One Vic-20 Home Computer
Setting: Fine
Output: One Commodore 64 Home Computer (Bread Box Model)

Note: Nice. I wonder how far this thing can go? ~Rosen

Input: One Commodore 64 Home Computer
Setting: Fine
Output: One Commodore Amiga 2000 Personal Computer

Note: Wow, video toaster and everything! I see why you guys are sticking everything under the sun in this bad boy. I might have to experiment a little more. ~Rosen

Input: One Commodore Amiga 1000 Personal Computer
Setting: Rough
Output: One Commodore Amiga CDTV Entertainment Console

Note: Ugh, I guess I put it on the wrong setting. I'll have to put it back one. ~Rosen

Input: One Commodore Amiga CDTV Entertainment Console
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One Commodore Amiga CD32 Video-Game Console

Note: Cheeky. But I can fix this. Let's see if we can go back now… ~Rosen

Input: One Commodore Amiga CD32 Video-Game Console
Setting: 1:1
Output: One low-flow porcelain toilet with branding visually similar to that of the Commodore International corporation, but with the word "Commodore" replaced with "Commode".

Note: I wanted to go back! This damned contraption is worse than a casino. ~Rosen

Note: Welcome to my world, Rosen. -Veritas

Test 914-0523
Name: Dr. Piedmont
Date: 06/04/2019
Total Items: 5 Blocks of Marble Measuring 5.17 meters x 1.99 meters, 5 chisels

Input: 1 of the aforementioned blocks, 1 chisel
Setting: Fine
Output: A marble sculpture of SCP-096 covering its face, a chisel is laid down perpendicular to the statue. Excess marble is scattered around the statue

Note: Nice little throwback to my past inputs, 914. I'm going to be giving this away if Veritas allows it. - Dr. Piedmont

Note: Good luck finding someone willing to have that on their desk, Piedmont. -Veritas

Input: 1 marble block, 1 chisel
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A marble sculpture of SCP-914, the sculpture does not seem to possess any anomalous properties, a chisel is laid on top of the sculpture. Excess marble is inside the 'Intake' and 'Output' booths.

Input: 1 marble block, 1 chisel
Setting: Coarse
Output: A badly sculpted marble sculpture of Dr. Piedmont, a chisel is embedded in the sculpture's left leg. Excess marble is scattered around the statue.

Input: 1 marble block, 1 chisel
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A marble sculpture of the SCP Foundation insignia, with multiple anomalous items etched onto the outside of the logo. A chisel is laid down in front of the statue. Excess marble is scattered around the statue.

Note: This is actually beautiful, I might keep this. - Dr. Piedmont

Input: 1 marble block, 1 chisel
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A marble sculpture of a cupcake, a chisel is laid down right next to the sculpture. Excess marble is scattered around it.

Note: I actually survived the week, wow. All of these tests have been really interesting and I plan to do more in the future. I expect Researcher Darby to uphold his part of the deal we made at the beginning of the week. In the meantime, I'm going to find a place to put these statues for now. - Dr. Piedmont

Note: The party is next week in my office, everyone except the D-class are invited - Researcher Darby

Test 914-0524
Name: Researcher Lombardi
Date: 06/04/2019
Total Items: A 'Get Well' card addressed to Researcher Darby.

Input: One 'Get Well' card addressed to Researcher Darby, one permanent marker
Setting: Fine
Output: One 'Get Well' card addressed to Researcher Darby, one permanent marker. The text '914' has been stamped on the inside of the card with the marker ink. The cardstock has been altered in two notable ways. The edges of the card have been sharpened to be roughly 75% more likely to cause papercuts. In this scenario, the paper fibers will separate from the card and become lodged in the injury, inhibiting blood clotting.

Note: I'll just send Researcher Darby a photo of the card once I'm sure it doesn't contain some kind of dangerous memetic message. - Lombardi

Note: Don't kill Darby, I need that cupcake party. -Dr. Piedmont

Note: I would burn (that could be bad) dispose of that as soon as your done. I don't like the chances of something happening. - Intern Lunar

Note: Thanks for the get well cards - Researcher Darby

Test 914-0525
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 06/04/2019
Items: Five various Nintendo Entertainment System cartridges.

Note: As near and dear to me as these games all are, they've had their time. -Prof. Wren

Input: NES cartridge, "The Legend of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link."
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of melted plastic with bits of circuit board parts sticking out of it.

I'll admit there was a slight vendetta here. The battery that kept save files alive in these older games died on me right as I finally reached the last dungeon for the first time. -Prof. Wren

Input: NES cartridge, "Dragon Warrior"
Setting: Coarse
Output: The same cartridge, fully disassembled, with parts neatly sorted.

Input: NES cartridge, "Super Mario Bros."
Setting: 1:1
Output: NES cartridge, "Soopa Koopa Troopas." Game plays exactly like the input, but with the player controlling a "Koopa Troopa," one of the turtle-like enemies in the original game. Power-ups transformed the player character into either a "Koopa Paratroopa" (same but with wings) or a "Hammer Bro" (larger enemy that could throw hammers). Enemies are replaced with characters identified as being from the game's "Mushroom Kingdom," with Princess Peach taking Bowser's role as the primary antagonist.

Huh. Neat. -Prof. Wren

Input: NES cartridge, "Metroid."
Setting: Fine
Output: At first glance, the same cartridge. Testing later revealed the game to be an NES-quality version of the Game Boy Advance title, "Metroid: Zero Mission," a remake of the same game.

Note: Okay, that's just awesome. Permission to set both of these up in the break room? -Prof. Wren

Note: Be my guest, not that it matters though. 914 didn't change the physical cartridge, NES can't run that kind of game, it's too complex for it. -Veritas

Input: NES cartridge, "Super Mario Bros. 3."
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A reddish-brown piece of plastic-like material in the shape of a large elm leaf. At Prof. Wren's request, a D-class was sent in to retrieve the leaf. Leaf disappeared upon contact with D-class. D-class grew increasingly agitated and violent over the next few minutes before crying out, after which they expired. Autopsy later revealed the D-class' body was in the process of converting to that of procyon lotor, a common raccoon, before death.

Yikes, what a way to go. Glad I decided not to take a chance with a real-life video game power-up, though admittedly I just expected the guy to grow ears and a tail. -Prof. Wren

Glad to see that the break room is getting some love. I'll test microwaves tomorrow, so wish me luck that we get something good for the break room again, like the super-toaster. -R. Luke

Test 914-0526
Name: Dr. Anton
Date: 06/04/2019
Total Items: A 35-page document containing all the SCP-914 test logs.

Input: Aforementioned Items
Setting: Fine
Output: a “condensed” version of the SCP-914 test logs, with most of the entries missing. Comparison to initial documents include the deletion of dozens of test logs, specifically those involving Researcher I. Darby, Prof. Calloway, M.T.Johnston, Dr. Anton, Dr. Teresa, Dr. Nukea, and SCP-096. All tests involving the alternate dials generated by SCP-914 on 27/03/2019. Also removes many comments made by researchers in remaining tests. Resulting document comprises only 15 pages, and the remainder are blank. Only addition is a section describing this current test.

Note: Okay, Lemme see…First, Why expunge MT Johnston? I thought 914 loved the guy. More importantly, why expunge those specific tests? I get Darby, Nukea, And Calloway, but MY entries? That’s Just bias. -Anton

Test 914-0527
Name: Researcher Lombardi
Date: 06/04/2019
Total Items: One canvas, easel, and a selection of oil based paints. One VHS containing a selection of 'The Joy of Painting' Episodes.

Note: 914 has been encouraged to do creative acts before - let's see if adding instruction helps. - Lombardi

Input: One canvas, easel, and a selection of oil based paints. One VHS containing a selection of 'The Joy of Painting' Episodes.
Setting: 1:1
Output: As above. The paints have been mixed to more closely match the colors commonly used by Bob Ross. The contents of the VHS has been altered to contain different episodes of 'The Joy of Painting' - all of which have been verified identical to existing broadcast episodes.

Note: 914 has locked onto the theme at least. Now we will test if upping the setting results in a painting of the given style. - Lombardi

Input: Output of previous test
Setting: Fine
Output: A VHS case formed out of the canvas, easel, and plastics of the paint containers. Case has a grayish brown color, created by mixing all of the paints together. VHS now contains episodes of 'The Joy of Multidimensional Manipulation'. Each episode depicts Bob Ross operating 914 to produce fantastical and anomalous creations.

Ross demonstrates a great deal of skill and familiarity with the device, explaining why he places a given item into 914, along with other factors that influence its output. These include specific thoughts or visualizations in his mind, temperature and humidity levels of his studio, and amount of light shining upon 914. These explanations do not provide insight into 914's operation, as they are offered as a means to an end. Example: "I've turned it up to the 'fine' setting now. I want super-cooled fiber optic sheets, so while I turn this key I of course need to think about my grandparents driving along a busy highway discussing their taxes."

Each episode follows a similar format:

Bob Ross declares what sort of creation he will be making during the show.
He wheels out a series of bins containing common household objects.
He begins refining them on various settings - frequently switching between 'very fine' and 'coarse' to create some advanced piece of work and then break it down safely into component parts.
Frequently he will manually combine or alter items outside of the device, usually to cause some sort of expected chemical change.
In cases where an output is hazardous, he has appropriate safety gear on site both for himself and for viewers. This can take the form of censoring of video or muting of audio if output contains a memetic hazard.
Has a similar arc to most 'Joy of Painting' episodes in that the creations seem to progress steadily towards the desired output, regress considerably halfway through the process, only to come together perfectly at the end.
The tape contains the following episodes:

'A crystalline trumpet that emits music notes of pure energy'
'Anti-gravity rollerskates'
'Edible stars'
'A rainbow that can be molded like clay.'
Note: Of course Bob Ross makes it look easy. - Lombardi'

Test 914-0528
Name: Researcher Luke
Date: 07/04/2019
Total items: Three microwaves.

Gonna be frank, this test is mainly for replacing the break room microwave. I think my tutor used that thing when he was Junior Researcher twenty years ago. -R. Luke

Input: One microwave.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A microwave oven.

Input: One microwave.
Setting: Fine
Output: The microwave now possesses a red and black exterior. The following new settings were noticed: "Cook", "Grill", "Fry", "Melt", "Incinerate" and "Well-Done". All do what one would expect, however "Well-Done" will turn the food inside into a black "rock" and "Incinerate" turn the food into ash.

Note: I requested for this to be added to the on-site break room. -R. Luke

Input: One microwave.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The microwave appears unchanged. It was moved to a testing area before it was turned on by a D-Class. After being turned one, the microwave liquefies anything in an approximately five meter radius. The researcher's present, including Researcher Luke, suffered from light burns. The object was destroyed utilizing a laser.

Once more: 914 refined an object to something that gave me burns. I think I'll no longer use heat-related items for testing for the foreseeable time. -R. Luke

Test 914-0529
Name: Dr. Freeman
Date: 07/04/2019
Total items: Five USB drives containing all fifty-two episodes of the Canadian-American 'edutainment' program The Magic School Bus (1994).

Input: One USB Drive
Setting: Rough
Output: Plastic and silicon scraps

Input: One USB Drive
Setting: Coarse
Output: A disassembled USB Drive

Input: One USB Drive
Setting: 1:1
Output: One USB Drive containing the entirety of the 'edutainment' series Beakman's World.

Input: One USB Drive
Setting: Fine
Output: One USB Drive containing fifty-two episodes of The Magic School Bus. All fifty-two original episodes remain, but have content edited to reflect modern and/or more advanced scientific knowledge—, Busasaurus has the characters encounter small feathered theropods, The Magic School Bus in the Rain Forest has the class encounter several tribesmen native to the Amazon, and their role in the ecosystem of the rain forest is discussed, and the asteroid Ceres, as well as the dwarf planets Eris and Sedna are visited in the episode The Magic School Bus Gets Lost in Space (though Pluto is still referenced as being a planet, likely to preserve the ending of the episode).

Input: One USB Drive
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One USB Drive containing data for over three-hundred episodes of The Magic School Bus. Due to SCP-914 being unable to violate the law of conservation of energy, several episodes are bitcrushed or compressed to the point of being unwatchable. Data recovery tools have found that, in addition to the original fifty-two episodes, the new material covers topics such as forensic science, probability, modern computer maintenance, dark matter, and anthropology.

Test 914-0530
Name: Dr Clocks
Date: 07/04/2019
Total items: Three copies of The Bible.

Input: One Bible
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Qur'an. The output though seems slightly thicker then regular versions. Possibly due to the amount of pages in the Bible.

Input: One Bible
Setting: Fine
Output: One Bible. The Old Testament though is shown to be shortened and at some points, entire chapters erased. The New Testament however, is larger and with more books inside. It is unknown if they are authentic and were cut by the Vatican centuries ago, or if 914 fabricated them.

Note: It certainly seems interesting. SCP-914 perhaps removed some parts of the Old Testament due to its more 'menacing' nature. -Dr Clocks

Input: One Bible
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One red book. The book cover seems to have no markings aside from the words 'Shormaush Urdal' engraved on the spine in yellow. Upon retrieval by Dr Clocks, Dr Clocks immediately fainted. After he woke up, he started yelling incoherently, the exact nature and definition of these words are unknown. Dr Clocks was then amnesticised and the book safely incinerated.

Note: I still have a goddamn headache. Guess that's what happens when you accidentally read some sort of cult book. -Dr Clocks

Test 914-0531
Name: Dr. Piedmont
Date: 08/04/2019
Total Items: One handwritten note

Input: One note reading "Thank you, 914"
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One anomalous note reading "Thank you, 914". Upon coming into contact with said note, the subject praises and compliments SCP-914 for 9 minutes and 14 seconds.

Note: That was one of the worst experiences of my life, I am going to dispose of this as soon as possible

Test 914-0532
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 08/04/2019
Total Items: A transcript of the instance of SCP-2305-A documenting how to eliminate SCP-682, copied from Experiment Log T-98816-OC108/682.

Note: We got a request for this one from the guys handling SCP-682's containment. Their hope is that, by refining 2305's useless termination procedure through 914, it will output something that actually works. Not familiar with 682, but if they're trying to kill it rather than just contain it, that sounds kinda important. Anyway, here goes nothing. -Prof. Wren

Input: The transcript.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A single, blank sheet of paper. Holding it causes the first page of a new SCP-2305-A instance to appear. Flipping the page over to the right reveals further pages of the instance, while flipping it to the left goes back. The entire instance documents an elaborate, 266-page plan for eliminating SCP-682 involving various rituals, SCPs, and other technologies, many of which are not yet known to exist or even be physically possible. As per usual with instances of SCP-2305-A, the proposed plan fails to destroy its intended target; specifically, the plan ends with the entire universe being crushed to a sphere roughly 28 nanometers in diameter, which 682 then devours with a satisfied belch. The "moral of the story" given at the end simply reads, "Nice try."

Note: Yikes. If that's what 682's like, it's no wonder they want it dead. Still, why anyone would even think to use an aardvark for something like that is beyond me…not to mention kinda gross. Anyway, gonna make a copy of this in case the folks on 682 or 2305 research want/need it, then try again. Can't do much worse, right? -Prof. Wren

Input: The augmented transcript from previous experiment.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A blank piece of paper; holding it causes a cognitohazardous symbol to appear to the holder. Looking at the symbol leaves the viewer in a state of paralyzing fear until their line of sight is interrupted or they let go of the paper, at which point the symbol disappears. Object was safely incinerated shortly afterwards.

Note: Okay, yeah, that was definitely worse. Permission to go have that image wiped from my mind forever? Pretty please? -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0533
Name: Doctor S.
Date: 08/04/2019
Total Items: Four plastic prescription vials of 24 █████████ brand pain killers, each of which weighing 15 grams. Official Site-██ Prescription sticker on front of vial states: "██████████ brand Pain Killers. Take two pills every eight hours for pain relief."

Note: Seeing as I keep having to deal with the injuries that this machine keeps piling up, I might as well use it to make my job easier to deal with in the future. Also, try to limit things that can very easily lead to bodily harm, I've been given the nickname "Darby's Personal Nurse" by the rest of Site-██'s medical staff. -Doctor S.

Input: One of the above mentioned vials.
Setting: Rough
Output: A smoking pile of burning plastic, crushed up shards of opium, glue, shredded paper, and ink that are equivalent to the mass initially imputed.

I disposed of the mess into the correct disposal, but the smell of burning plastic is still lingering. I will wash out the room when I finish. -Doctor S.

Input: One of the above mentioned vials.
Setting: Coarse
Output: An empty prescription vial, with the lid removed, and a pill of pain killers sorted by recommended dosage.

Note: After confirming the pills are not anomalous or different than the input, I put the pills back into vial for re-use. -Doctor S.

Input: Re-assembled output of previous test.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One solidified powder prescription vial. The lid mechanism broke after attempting to open the bottle, which revealed 26 plastic hollow pills. Consumption of the vial in correct dosages produces same result as original pain killers.

Input: One of the above mentioned vials.
Setting: Fine
Output: Prescription Vial of 12 unmarked pills, each of which are the equivalent to the mass of two pills. Official Site-██ Prescription Sticker on front of vial now says "914 brand Pain Killers. Take one every 24 hours for instantaneous pain relief." D-Class testing reveals that all previous sensations that could be defined as uncomfortable are immediately alleviated for exactly 24 hours. No negative side effects have been witnessed at this time.

Note: After having it tested for anomalous tendencies, I'm going to bring this to the lab for possible reverse-engineering. Lord knows that you people could use these. -Doctor S.

Input: One of the above mentioned vials
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One Plastic Prescription Vial of 24 unmarked pills. Official Site-██ Prescription Sticker on front of vial now says "914 brand Pain. Take one every 12 hours for instantaneous pain." Within three seconds of being consumed by D-Class, subjects fall to ground screaming in agony. Within 1 hour, subjects stopped screaming due to loss of voice, but continued to roll of ground in agony for 2 more hours before being administered a "914 brand Painkiller" to test which drug is more powerful. Subjects state there was still a dull throb of pain across their entire body after being administered pain killer. A physical evaluation of subjects reveal no lingering damage to internal organ structure or bodily functions.

Note: I guess 914 doesn't care much for "Do No Harm" -Doctor S.

Test 914-0535
Name: Researcher Festiv
Date: 09/04/2019
Items: 30 of SCP-38 produced SCP-500

Input: 30 SCP-38 produced SCP-500
Setting: fine
Output: A red sphere. Holding it heals the holder of all minor injuries, But holding it for 10 seconds will make cuts appear on the holder.

That hurt. Guess it makes the cuts and wont heal disease because the 38 produced 500 has a fail rate of 70% - Researcher Festiv.

Test 914-0536
Name: Doctor Sheath
Date: 09/04/2019
Total items: Five incomplete test logs, with the input as "SCP-682."

Note: Don't lie, we’re all curious what would happen. Hopefully 914 can fill in the gaps for us. -Dr. Sheath

Input: One incomplete test log, with input "SCP-682" and setting "Rough."
Setting: 1:1
Output: One incomplete test log, with input "Rough" and setting "SCP-682."

Note: No, not quite, 914. Try again.

Input: One incomplete test log, with input "SCP-682" and setting "Coarse."
Setting: 1:1
Output: One incomplete test log, with input "SCP-682" and setting "course." Included at the bottom is a childlike doodle of SCP-682 in a racecar driving along a race course.

Note: I'm not sure it understands what I'm going for.

Input: One incomplete test log, with input "SCP-682" and setting "1:1."
Setting: 1:1
Output: One incomplete test log, with input "SCP-1" and setting "682:682."

Input: One incomplete test log, with input "SCP-682" and setting "Fine."
Setting: 1:1
Output: One incomplete test log for Experiment Log T-98816-OC108/682, detailing an attempt to kill SCP-682 by throwing SCP-914 at it.

Input: One incomplete test log, with input "SCP-682” and setting “Very Fine."
Setting: 1:1
Output: One piece of paper, with a cognitohazardous symbol on it. Those who look at it fall into a dreamlike state where they imagine a titanic SCP-682 ruling over something. No two dreams have been the same thus far.

Note: The paper has been incinerated at the request of many. All I saw was 682 burning down the entire planet. Apparently I got lucky. Some researchers witnessed it eating a galaxy, others saw it killing individual family members, and at least two saw it try to seduce them.

Test 914-0537
Name: Researcher Nyka
Date: 09/04/2019
Total Items: Two copies of SCP-2337's documentation

Note: All personnel wore 26M ear protection as a precaution.

Input: One copy of SCP-2337's documentation
Setting: 1:1
Output: One copy of SCP-2337's documentation translated into Esperanto, with SCP-2337's speech in the interview log being a mangled variant.

Input: One copy of SCP-2337's documentation
Setting: Fine
Output: A recipe for "Stranglefruit Casablanca" written in a style consistent with SCP-2337's language. Recipe appears to be for a type of cocktail that involves a mixture of gummy worms and several types of alcoholic beverages, but due to ongoing difficulties with parsing 2337's language, the exact steps are still unknown.

Requesting permission to try and mix this if the Linguistics Department gives the OK. -Researcher Nyka

Test 914-0538
Name: Researcher Devyn
Date: 09/04/2019
Total Items: One handheld catalytic generator, 18% conversion efficiency.

Note: Researcher Devyn is on assignment from Dr. King.

Note: In case anyone is wondering, a catalytic generator produces electricity via a catalyst between [DATA EXPUNGED]. A handheld unit like the one provided can produce up to 48 watts of power an hour for a period of up to 4 hours. However, the process currently leaves 82% of the materials in an unusable state without refinement, resulting in the short life span before replacement of materials is needed. The goal of this experiment is to produce a generator with close to 100% efficiency, in order to tackle the Foundation's growing energy needs. -Researcher Devyn

Input: The catalytic generator.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 157 apple seeds 157 smaller catalytic generators, each having 1/157 the mass of the original and measuring approximately the size of a piece of candy corn. Tests revealed that, while each generator had 99.4% conversion efficiency, they only output 0.04W an hour. Additionally, a cognitohazardous anomaly causes anyone directly viewing them to perceive them as appleseeds; viewing through a camera feed mitigates the anomaly. Further analysis of the changes in the devices' technology is currently pending.

Note: Dammit, should have known this would happen…also, what the hell are you people talking about? Those are clearly [EXPLETIVE DELETED] apple seeds. -Researcher Devyn

Note: Suggestions to deliver the generators to Dr. King are preemptively denied.

Date: 10/04/2019
Total Items: 5 Papers on Quantum Theory, 5 small balls of steel, 4 beef Ramen bowls;
Note: Who took that last bowl of beef ramen? Also, don't ask what the point of this is because I have no answer. - Researcher Darby

Input: Paper on Quantum Theory, Ball of Steel;
Setting: Rough
Output: Shreds of Paper and Steel fragments;
Note: Not surprised - Researcher Darby

Input: Paper on Quantum Theory, Ball of Steel, Beef Ramen bowl;
Setting: Coarse
Output: Paper, Steel, Plastic, and Ramen neatly separated along with a puddle of ink;
Note: Again, standard coarse reaction to input. - Researcher Darby

Input: Paper on Quantum Theory, Ball of Steel, Beef Ramen bowl;
Setting: 1:1
Output: Paper on Planetary Physics, Steel Cube, Chicken Ramen bowl;
Note: In my opinion 914, turning a perfectly good bowl of Beef Ramen to a bowl of Chicken Ramen is regression not equivalent exchange. - Researcher Darby

Input: Paper on Quantum Theory, Ball of Steel, Beef Ramen bowl;
Setting: Fine
Output: Paper describing 7th Dimension travel, Steel bull, Cooked beef Ramen, Researcher Darby;
Note: I'm looking at myself watching me write this note…. - Researcher Darby

Input: Paper on Quantum Theory, Ball of Steel, Beef Ramen bowl;
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Animate Steel Beetle with Ramen and Plastic Legs and Paper Wings. Upon exiting output booth it charged at Researcher Darby's control booth and forced him to enter the Input booth. Researcher Darby's Intern attempted to rescue Researcher Darby but was stopped by a burst of ink from the Beetle and the Quantum Darby holding him back. Once Researcher Darby was fully inside the Input booth the Beetle initiated SCP-914 (On Very Fine) and managed to slip inside the input booth before it closed. When 914 finished refining, security personnel attempted to rescue Researcher Darby but instant examination of the Output booth showed that both Researcher Darby and the Beetle were gone.
Note: It had to happen. Otherwise, we would be stuck in a paradox, and nothing gets done. I would also like my Researcher status restored, as I am Researcher Darby and not a Quantum Anomaly. - Quantum Darby

Note: Darby, are you stealing my beef Ramen bowls through some sort of quantum shenanigans? Cause if you are then I would appreciate if you would stop as the Ramen is the food for my mug cat. Also try asking Rosen if he can help you with the status problem. Also where are you? -Intern Lunar.

Note: Apparently I don't exist anymore, I'd tell you my location but I'm not even sure where that is - Researcher Darby

Test 914-0541
Name: Researcher Festiv
Date: 10/04/2019
Item: A large stack of paper detailing complaints about 914 cluttering the break room

Input: Aforementioned stack of paper
Setting: Very fine
Output: A paper sphere that rolled into the break room. It then turned into a paper machine that latched onto a wall and then spread to both ends of the wall. When metal is put into its "input" slot it consumes the metal and extends the room in the direction of the wall. This process does not overlap into, or destroy other rooms. The break room, when viewed through a X-ray, appears normal, however.

Note: It consumes 3x of the resources needed, a sample shows it simply condenses the metal. it also plays a loud laugh track when a complainer enters the room -Researcher Festiv

Note: I thought that was a paper shredder, be careful where you step. Sorry -Intern Lunar

Note: I'll just put a sheet of metal over it then cover that with a carpet. The input has also been labled. - Researcher Festive

Test 914-0542
Name: Researcher Westrin:
Date: 10/04/2019
Item: 25 Pop-Tart™ toaster pastries, strawberry flavor.

Input: 5 strawberry Pop-Tarts™
Setting: Coarse
Output: Two large piles of crumbs, one brown in color and one white and red in color.

Input: 5 strawberry Pop-Tarts™
Setting: Rough
Output: One large square shaped pastry crust surrounded by large amounts of crumbs. The words "Et tu, Brute?" are written on the pastry in hardened frosting.

Input: 5 strawberry Pop-Tarts™
Setting: 1:1
Output: 5 Pop-Tarts™ with a spread of sugary filling on the top of the pastry. The inside of the Pop-Tarts™ are replaced with hardened frosting.

Input: 5 strawberry Pop-Tarts™
Setting: Fine
Output: A recreation of the human tongue constructed entirely out of Pop-Tart™ materials. Hardened frosting is placed on specific parts of the "tongue" that seem to imitate inflamed papillae.

Input: 5 strawberry Pop-Tarts™
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small creature resembling Homo Vindicta at roughly 40 centimeters in height. The specimen has skin constructed out of hardened frosting. Shortly after creation, it grabbed a sharp piece of itself, stabbed its abdomen, in which it bled sugar filling. It appeared to "eat" the filling by forcefully shoving a handful into its facial area before becoming inert.

Total Items: One prosthetic arm, procured from Rosen.

Note: Make no mistake. This isn't a test. This is a funeral. In memory of N.C.E., and his
weird obsession with 914.

Input: Aforementioned prosthetic arm.
Setting: Rough
Output: 1 large pile of scrap metal, vaguely shaped like a gravestone.

Note: I know I said it wasn't a test. But that one guy with the theory that 914 understands the emotional stigma of items might be correct.

Test 914-0544
Name: Dr. Nukea
Date: 10/04/2019
Total Items: An estimated 2,874 copies of 17 again

Just wanna see the limit of 914 -Nukea

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Rough
Output: A giant sheet of plastic. On top of the plastic is another layer of polycarbonate plastic. There is also a large piece of paper covered in colors. The colors match the colors found on copies of 17 again.

Note: Alright. Just tested the limit. Don’t ask where I got so many copies, okay? -Nukea

Note: At this point, I think we're all just afraid to. -Prof. Wren

Note: I think amazon is out of stock on 17 again. -Intern Lunar

Total Items: 3 cupcakes

Note: Finally back from my break, and had that cupcake party. - Dr. Piedmont

Input: 1 cupcake
Setting: 1:1
Output: A frosting filled cupcake. All frosting is gone from the top of the cupcake.

Input: 1 cupcake
Setting: Rough
Output: A smashed cupcake.

Note: Not surprised by that - Dr. Piedmont

Input: 1 cupcake
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A seemingly normal cupcake, upon consuming it the subject begins to experience the symptoms of food poisoning and acquires internal bleeding.

Note: Dr. Piedmont was administered to Site-██'s medical ward shortly after the test, he is scheduled to return to testing in 3 days time.

Note: I practically expected that. I'm glad I won the bet, though. - Dr. Piedmont

Test 914-0548
Name: Dr. Matism
Date:10/04/2019
Total Items: 1 note reading "Don't expose me to a cognitohazard please."

Note: God [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] 914, you had one job! - Dr. Matism

Note: Who the hell put that thing in the cafeteria during pizza Wednesday? Everyone starved themselves! - Researcher Danok

Note: I just folded the pizza into a taco and put toppings on it. -Intern Lunar

Note: Can we hire Lunar? His ingenuity is baffling. - Dr. Matism

Note: Let him send his resume to my office. I have a feeling a position is going to open up if you keep up the level of professionalism that you currently have. -Veritas

Test 914-0549
Name: Jr. Researcher Stan
Date: 10/04/2019
Total Items: Three foil birthday balloons, brightly painted and filled with a mixture of air and helium. One balloon considerably larger than the others, in the shape of a honeybee.

Note: Had my birthday a few days ago and since these are still floating around I thought they would be interesting to work with. - Stan

Input: One balloon
Setting: 1:1
Output: One balloon, with the foil molded into the shape of a beehive. Painted randomly with the same color scheme as the original balloon

I really don't want this to become a thing… -Stan

Input: One balloon
Setting: Fine
Output: A small pill-shaped capsule, roughly 13 cm wide and 30 cm long. Output booth was remotely opened, and upon opening, the capsule exploded open. It is theorized that 914 attempted to compress the helium into the container, but the materials were not strong enough to withstand the pressurized gas.

Input: One large honeybee shaped balloon

Note: I did NOT find it funny to enter my room after a long day to see a giant flying bee waiting in there for me. Really put the surprise in surprise party. I wonder what it will do with the provided materials. -Stan

Setting: Very Fine
Output: A balloon in the shape of a 1930s Akron class airship. The class of airship was designed to carry small fighter craft that could launch from and defend the ship. The airship floated out of the output booth and initially stayed in place. Jr. Researcher Stan, unaware of the purpose of Akron class airships, entered the experiment room to inspect the output. Upon JR. Stan coming close to the airship, multiple foil honeybees were released from the bottom of the craft. Personnel suffered multiple small stings from the metal stingers of the bees, which were found to not detach like their normal counterparts. The airship was eventually shot multiple times by security, which caused it to crash from loss of helium. The metal bees became inert after the "mothership" crashed.

Note: Guess bees are a thing now. I already generally disliked bees and 914 isn't helping.

Name: Researcher Lombardi
Date: 11/04/2019
Total Items: Two identical 300-piece puzzles. Puzzles depict a scene of consisting of a sailboat on the water at noon.

Input: One nearly completed 300 piece puzzle, with the exception of a randomly removed piece.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One nearly completed 280 piece puzzle of similar dimensions, with a single piece missing. Puzzle depicts a scene consisting of a family having a picnic in a forest clearing.

Input: The missing piece of the original input set.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A puzzle piece. Imagery on the piece matches up with the output of the previous test. However, the edges are cut to only line up with 3 of the 4 surrounding pieces.

Note: It would appear 914 has made the world's most frustrating Christmas Gift. - Lombardi

Input: One nearly completed 300 piece puzzle, with the exception of a randomly removed piece.
Setting: Fine
Output: One complete 500 piece puzzle. While no pieces are missing, puzzle is roughly 0.3% smaller to adjust for the missing mass. Two pieces show visual artifacts consistent with a 'content-aware fill' popular in modern image editing software. Puzzle depicts a scene consisting of a much more extravagant boat at sunset.

Input: The missing piece of the second input set.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One blank piece of cardboard cut into the shape of an asterisk. Object shows anomalous properties when placed over a gap in a piece of media. When this occurs, the object will reshape itself, growing or shrinking, until the missing area is covered. Object then changes color and content to match up with the host media. Removing the piece will revert it back to its original state. Testing with known documents has shown that while the filled portions of content seem plausible, they are not accurate. Using the object on the same piece of media repeatedly will give different results each time. Object has shown this reaction against holes, redactions, or censorship in text, pictures, and video.

Total items: One toolbox containing one each of the following: A flathead screwdriver, a Phillips screwdriver, a claw hammer, a ballpeen hammer, a 16' measuring tape, a hacksaw, needle-nose pliers, vice grips, a crescent wrench adjustable to up to 2-1/2", a set of metric Allen wrenches, and a set of standard Allen wrenches.

Note: If all goes well with this test, this will create the perfect multi-tool, suitable for any task. Then I…er, the Foundation, rather, can reverse-engineer it and market it for millions! -Dr. V█████

Input: The toolbox.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A large, multi-limbed arthropodal creature made of plastic and metal. Its abdomen and head resembled the toolbox. At the end of each limb was the end of one of the tools. Immediately upon the "Output" booth opening, the creature attacked Dr. V█████ and smashed his head in with its hammer-appendages, killing him instantly. Security personnel moved in and destroyed the creature.

Note: "If all goes well with this test?" He seriously said that? Since when has that ever happened with anything involving 914, especially on the Very Fine setting? I've only been here a few weeks and even I know better than that. -Prof. Wren

Note: If he was trying to do this for profit you could say he was being a tool. Also, yeah don't think Very Fine is going to do what you want. -Intern Lunar

Note: Why is the body count in my testing area on par with bloody 682's termination record? Am I not strict enough in security measures or are half of my research staff just drooling imbeciles?! - Veritas

Test 914-0556
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 11/04/2019
Items: Three 12 oz. bottles of homemade soda, one 8 oz. container of fruit salad, one bag of Earl Grey tea, 1 packet of hot sauce.

Notes: As disgusting as I'm sure that Passion Fruit-Ranch stuff 914 made a can for the other night, it did give me a couple of ideas. If these pan out, we might be able to market them on a front company for increased revenue. Or at least serve them in the break room. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 bottle of soda, 1 container of fruit salad.
Setting: Fine
Output: One 20 oz bottle of carbonated beverage. The label shows a variety of fruit made entirely out of bubbles.

Note: Tried a bit after it was cleared of hazards. As expected, it's soda with a mixed variety of fruit flavors, most prominently apple, grape, and strawberry. Marketability level: 8.5/10. -Prof. Wren

Input: One bottle of soda, one tea bag.
Setting: Fine
Output: One 12 oz bottle of brown liquid, warm to the touch, and two small cubes later identified as pure cane sugar. The label shows the Union Jack made entirely of bubbles.

Note: Tried a bit after it was cleared of hazards. Basically, it made carbonated tea and stripped the sugar I used to make the stuff out entirely. Yuck. Marketability level: 1.0/10. -Prof Wren

Input: One bottle of soda, one packet of hot sauce.
Setting: Fine
Output: One 12 oz bottle of fizzy red liquid, shaking violently. Security footage showed the label to have nuclear hazard symbols around the edges with the word "CAUTION!!" repeated over and over in between. Bottle exploded shortly after the "output" booth opened, spraying the booth with liquid and glass shards while lodging the cap in the ceiling. No indication of NBR hazards were found; explosion thought to be caused by the liquid being super-heated. Cleanup crews cleaned the "output" booth of soda spray and shattered glass without incident.

Note: I thought this one might be a bad idea going in, but I didn't think it'd be THAT bad. Marketability level: -∞/10. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0557
Name: Researcher Larua
Date: 12/04/2019
Total Items: 5 grey wool jackets covered in cat hair, 5 lint rollers

Greetings everyone, I'm Researcher Zenet Larua. I'm happy to finally have gotten permission to have access to this machine. From everything I've read, I'm quite excited to see what my experiments will yield. -Larua

Input: 1 jacket, 1 roller
Setting: Rough
Output: A jumble of wool, hair, and plastic all stuck together with adhesive.

Input: 1 jacket, 1 roller
Setting: Coarse
Output: Two neat piles of hair and wool respectively. The handle of the lint roller was sitting in the center of the room with each individual sheet from the lint roller stuck to the walls of the output chamber.

Note: Only my second test ever with this machine and it's already making me work with taking down all those sheets. I sneezed at one point prior to that cleaning up the cat hair, but most of the hair conveniently stuck to the sheets on the walls. Getting mixed signals from that. -Researcher Larua

Input: 1 jacket, 1 brush
Setting: 1:1
Output: The lint roller was replaced with a cat brush packed with the cat hair from the jacket. The jacket design was now orange and black tiger stripes.

Note: Why is the jacket black and orange when the cat hair was brown? Wait, the hair on the brush isn't even brown but red.

Input: 1 jacket, 1 brush
Setting: Fine
Output: The jacket and brush seemed to have fused together with the interior of the jacket being some kind of adhesive. When chemically examined, the adhesive was determined to be some kind of body wax for hair removal. Upon D-Class testing with a subject possessing a large amount of chest and back hair, all hair on their torso was cleanly removed when the jacket was taken off with surprisingly no resistance. D-Class subject also reported no sensation of pain with the hair removal, and the interior of the jacket itself was also devoid of the stripped hair. After just 10 minutes, said D-Class began complaining about irritation across their entire torso. Over the next 20 minutes, the D-Class was observed with an inflamed, beet-red torso that rapidly grew what appeared to be some form of cat fur before the inflammation settled. Two more D-Class were subjected to the test with not one bearing fur of the same species or design. The jacket was later disposed of via incineration.

Input: 1 jacket.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A normal looking wool cap. When given to a D-Class and placed on their head, they suddenly began to convulse before dropping to the floor and expiring with blood pooling around their body. Autopsy reports revealed that the subject's body hair had inverted and was growing on the inside of their skin. It is also noted that the growth was so forceful and enhanced that their hair wound its way into their flesh and organs, and even began growing into their bones. The hat was placed into storage for later testing on non-biological items.

Note: I'm getting sick just reading this report… I'm glad I didn't actually do the autopsy. -Researcher Larua

Test 914-0558
Name: Researcher Festiv
Date: 12/04/2019
Input: three AI cores, three personnel files of Researcher Festiv

Note: I know its unlikely. I just want to see if it will happen.

Input: One of each aforementioned item
Setting: Fine
Output: One AI core made, when plugged in it doesn't display the standard AI interface, but instead displays a blank personnel file. One personnel file, unchanged

Input: One of each aforementioned item
Setting: Fine
Output: One AI core, when plugged in a constant ticking can be heard, followed by the sound of an explosion and a machine breaking 20 seconds after. One personnel file, unchanged

Note: Sentry down!

Input: One of each aforementioned item
Setting: Fine
Output: One AI core, when plugged in, an AI resembling SCP-079 was present. When interviewed on a computer disconnected from the network, it showed it has nothing but loyalty to the Foundation. One file now contains the page for SCP-079.

Note: I'd love to run a few tests with it as the operator but considering it's that close to 079 it's too dangerous. The core has been wiped. -Researcher Festiv

Test 914-0559
Name: Researchers Calloway and Darby
Date: 12/04/2019
Total Items: 15 kilograms of steel, 15 capacitors, 2 hard drives, 2 notes with smiley faces

Note {Darby}: I am missing a hard drive due to someone forgetting which way goes up in transit and breaking it. Also I have had my Researcher status restored on probation, they still don't believe I'm the same Darby that went into 914 and came out [REDACTED] years prior to that test.

Note: These next two tests were performed by Researcher Darby.

Input: 6 kilograms steel, 6 capacitors, hard drive
Setting: Fine
Output: 6 1-kilogram Steel cockroaches run by AA batteries (presumably what the capacitors transformed into), 1 control module with mini USB female port.

Note {Darby}: I can plug this into my laptop, let's see what it does. Oooh it controls the cockroaches. Apparently they locate nearby electronics and do something. Maybe R&D can use this or… maybe not, the cockroach just ate Calloway's laptop and is making a duplicate of itself from the mass it gained.

Note {Calloway}: Just… keep those things away from me.

Input: Note with smiley face
Setting: Fine
Output: Note, however the smiley Face has been replaced by a Soviet Hammer and Sickle. Viewing of note effects the viewer causing them to believe they are Russian spies infiltrating the SCP Foundation. Researcher Darby was apprehended and administered anti-memetics after attempting to send Top Secret documentation about SCP-914, Site 19, Dr. Veritas, SCP-682, and others to the current Russian Spy Agency.

Note {Darby}: Я НЕ КОММУНИСТ 914 ПОЧЕМУ ВЫ ЭТО ДЕЛАЕТЕ ДЛЯ МЕНЯ! Теперь я не могу перестать говорить по-русски, и все это параноид от меня.

Note: Someone keep him on amnestics for a while before he hurts himself, or more importantly, my equipment. -Veritas

Note: These next two tests were performed by Researcher Calloway.

Input: 6 kilograms steel, 6 capacitors, hard drive.
Setting: Fine
Output: A steel device, which acts as a sort of "human hard drive", allowing the downloading and uploading of memories and thoughts via a cerebral device. Upon use on D-Class Personnel, all memories were erased, excepting those relating to SCP-914.

Note: Nice try, 914. -Researcher Calloway

Input: 1 note, with a smiley face drawn on it.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 note, with an anomalous symbol drawn on it. When viewed by a subject, the subject will become SCP-096 all personnel viewing the subject will become convinced that it is SCP-096 for fifteen minutes.

Note {Calloway}: The only reason I didn't get stuffed into a containment chamber faster than you can think is that we got a Class-D to get the test item. There were containment breach alarms going off everywhere, and we panicked, of course. Until it wore off, and we let the poor Class-D out of the containment chamber.

Note: These tests were performed by both Researchers

Input: 3 kilograms of steel, 3 capacitors, Note {Calloway's}
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Twisted mass of steel, copper, and paper in the shape of an Archaic rune. Study reveals that had the rune been on paper it would have imparted a blind rage upon viewers, causing them to attempt to terminate any living being nearby.

Note {Darby}: I did not expect 914 to fail that bad at killing us, Calloway, want to do another test with my note instead?

Input: 3 kilograms of steel, 3 capacitors, note {Darby's}
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Metal cube with paper symbols on the sides, the symbols compel the viewer to press a large glowing button on the cube. Upon both Researchers pressing the button, it sent out a wave of energy throughout the entirety of Site [REDACTED], disabling most security and containment systems and causing a Major Containment Breach. Thankfully, the SCPs that escaped containment were drawn to Researcher Darby and Calloway and attempted to eliminate them, causing massive casualties to personnel in their way. The effect of the cube lasted for 3 hours upon which the SCP's were contained and repairs began.

Note {Darby}: I couldn't resist it, looks like my researcher status is again in question. I'm going to my roomCell until Veritas figures out what to do with me.

Note: This was a major disaster, we had 34% of D-Class, 18% of Research Staff, 30% of my Security Forces and my secretary killed by the Containment Breach and we still have not re-contained all of them. Thank God for fail-safes or it could have been worse - Security Chief Brandt

Note: Dr. Veritas' request to reassign Researcher Darby and Calloway to the mobile Site orbiting Mars has been denied. His request to reassign Darby and Calloway to the Research base in Antarctica is currently under review. - Site Director Hackett

Test 914-0560
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 12/04/2019
Total Items: One diagram for a cuckoo clock written on a 27" pine 2x4, one 36-oz bronze cube, two otamatones.

Note: Half a test to see if 914 can follow a blueprint, half an attempt to update my alarm clock. -Prof. Wren

Input: The 2x4, the bronze cube, the otamatones.
Setting: Fine
Output: A 1/72 scale model of an SR-71 blackbird made out of wood, bronze, and white plastic. If thrown, it glides through the air at up to 20km/h while making a noise similar to a pair of otamatones being used to play discordant notes.

Note: While disappointing and slightly annoying to listen to, I have to admit this is pretty impressive looking. Requesting permission to keep this in my quarters. -Prof. Wren

Note: Get those things out of here, they're giving me a headache. -Veritas

Test 914-0561
Name: Researcher Z. Larua
Date: 12/04/2019
Total Items: 5 'Rocket' stacking tip pencils from the 1990s

Input: 1 pencil
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of graphite powder with plastic shards in it.

Input: 1 pencil
Setting: Coarse
Output: Each individual tip was turned into its own pencil, with the plastic case remade into individual single-tip cases.

Note: I'm writing the initial draft of this report with these, and holy hell are my fingers cramping. -Larua

Input: 1 pencil
Setting: 1:1
Output: One miniature rocket firework that automatically ignited and launched out of the output when the door opened. It flew around for a few seconds before bursting open and releasing several mini firework explosions. The number of explosions matched the number of tips and the explosion color matched the color of the plastic case.

Note: Heh, 'rocket' pencil. -Larua

Input: 1 pencil
Setting: Fine
Output: An ordinary #2 pencil.

Note: Seriously? That's it? Does 914 see these pencils as so inefficient that it views a regular pencil as a major upgrade? That hurts 914. That's my childhood you're stepping on.

Input: 1 pencil
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The same pencil, physically identical to the input. Upon testing, the pencil displayed an anomalous effect when the slightest amount of pressure was placed on either the tip or the back of the pencil to cycle the tips forward. The pressure would cause the tip on the opposite end to be forcefully launched outward in excess of 100m/s. These 'shots' made little to no sound except on impact with another object. Graphite tip was refined into some kind of material similar to obsidian.

Note: Another 'rocket' joke it seems, except this one is notably more lethal than the first. -Larua

Test 914-0562
Name: Junior Researcher Kenwol
Date: 12/04/2019
Total Items: 100 D20s

Input:10 D20s
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 D900

Note: How can I use this, 914? How? What am I supposed to do? Roll initiative, oh sorry, I only have a D900 on hand - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Input: 10 D20s
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 10 normal D20s 10 D20s that always roll 20

Note: Do I have permission to keep these? - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Input: 80 D20s
Setting: Fine
Output: A D20 exceptionally larger than a normal D20, by about 80 times. Closer examination shows that is is the same mass of 80 D20s

Note: Where are we supposed to store this? - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Note: Where do we store any of these things? - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Note: Mind if I borrow that? I want to test a theory. -Prof. Wren

Note: Go ahead. - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Test 914-0563
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 12/04/2019
Total Items: The gargantuan D20 created in a previous test.

Note: I have an idea here. -Prof. Wren

Input: The D20.
Setting: Coarse
Output: 80 regular 20-sided dies with numerals, sorted so that groups of 4 dice each all have 1 number on every side.

Note: Whoops. Should have known it might sort things a little too well. -Prof. Wren

Note: So that's what we are gonna do with it - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Note: Wait, can I have one of them, I have a pretty good idea - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Test 914-0564
Name: Junior Researcher Kenwol
Date: 12/04/2019
Total Items: 5 D20s with only 1 number (all sides the same number) Each die being 1-5, 5 D20s that always roll 20. Both from previous tests

Input: 1 D20 with only 1s, 1 D20 that only rolls 20s
Setting: Very fine
Output: A blob of plastic, that when dropped says "1"

That didn't work as expected, let's try a different setting - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Input: 1 D20 with only 2s, 1 D20 that only rolls 20s
Setting: 1:1
Output: A plastic note with the number 2 written on it.

Note: Seriously 914? I just want a dice that always rolls a specific number - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Input: 1 D20 with only 3s, 1 D20 that only rolls 20s
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 D20 that only rolls 3s A normal D20 the mass of 2

Note: Finally! Got what I wanted! - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Note: Turns out I'm just good at rolling 3s.. - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Note: I give up - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Note: Double-checked to verify it wasn't loaded. 5 rolls yielded a 7, 12, 19, 2, and 15 respectively. I think this thing's safe to go for game night, guys. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0565
Name: Researcher Z. Larua
Date: 13/04/2019
Total Items: 1 note, 1 pencil

I'm hoping I can get some insight into more direct and efficient testing if I can somehow determine what this machine has an affinity for. -Larua

Input: 1 note that reads "What do you desire, 914?", 1 pencil
Setting: 1:1
Output: A cognitohazardous note with "DARBY-CALLOWAY" burned into it. Upon viewing the paper, Researcher Larua began muttering "I must deliver them" continuously.

Incident Report: Researcher was then detained by faculty staff and escorted to the med-bay for amnestic administration. Prior to reaching the med-bay, Researcher Larua had escaped and was later found in Dr. Veritas' office. He was attempting to coerce the doctor, in a monotone voice, to redact his ruling to send Darby and Calloway to Antarctica.

Note: We've ascertained in the past that 914 isn't sentient, at least not as we understand it. Starting to wonder, then, if those two aren't anomalies themselves…given how many of Darby's experiments end in stuff going KABLOOEY I'd suggest Keter classification. -Prof. Wren

Note: I'm not giving either of them the satisfaction, Wren. The only two anomalous things are their stupid luck and my patience. -Veritas

Note: Fair enough, boss, but if they do another collab like this I'm evacuating the premises and would suggest everyone else do their best to keep up! -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0566
Name: Prof. Wren, accompanied by D-4884
Date: 13/04/2019
Total Items: One CD ("Queen: Greatest Hits")

Note: Sacrilegious, I know, but CDs are on their way out anyway, and this copy's scratched badly enough that "Bicycle Race" and "Fat Bottomed Girls" don't even play, so what good is it really? As for the D-Class…I plan on using Very Fine today, so I'm taking precautions. -Prof. Wren

Input: The "Queen: Greatest Hits" CD
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A new CD, "Muhammad Ali's Greatest Hits," showing a green silhouette of the legendary boxer against a yellow background on the cover art. No tracklist supplied.

Note: D-4884 was supplied with headphones and a CD player, and instructed to listen to the album. D-4884 described it as an announcer detailing a match between Ali and George Foreman, shortly after which his body jerked violently as if struck by a hard punch. This continued for nearly █ minutes before D-4884 was terminated by a violent twist of the head focused at the jaw, breaking his neck. Analysis of the placement and timing of the perceived blows coincided with footage of the "Rumble in the Jungle" match between the two aforementioned boxers in 1974. The album is being transferred to anomalous object storage.

Note: "Greatest Hits" indeed. Ouch. Stuff like this is why we should tread cautiously with the Very Fine setting, guys. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0567
Name: Researcher Luke
Date: 13/04/2019
Total Items: Four MasterCards, each with a balance of $100 USD.

Input: One MasterCard.
Setting: Coarse
Output: One Younique credit card. Value of the card essentially worthless.

Note: I was allowed to cash in the $2 on the card. I got two candy bars if anybody is wondering. -R. Luke

Input: One MasterCard.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One VisaCard with a balance of 88,68€.

Input: One MasterCard.
Setting: Fine
Output: The card appears unchanged. When used, it seemingly pays with money from random person's bank accounts, even if they don't own a credit card.

Input: One MasterCard.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The card appears unchanged. When picked up by Researcher Luke, it began materializing money in the output-booth. During the process, a sudden drop in Researcher Like's bank account balance was noticed and is proportional to the money created by the object. Anomalous activities ceased when the object was dropped. The object was moved to anomalous objects-storage and the money was returned to Researcher Luke.

Note: Oh boy, one day this thing's gonna ruin my existence. -R. Luke

Test 914-0568
Name: Prof. Wren & D-08-G64
Date: 13/04/2019
Total Items: One gallon of unleaded fuel in a jerry can, 1 Vespa moped.

Input: The gas can.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 gas can.

Note: D-class instructed to fill the moped with the resultant fuel and start the engine. The engine started with no issue. Further testing found the fuel had a 1500% efficiency increase for a span of 10 minutes before the test was ended.

Note: Well that was a lot less exciting than I expected. -Prof. Wren

Note: The moped was found to have transformed in storage 3 hours later, now sporting a 1800cc engine. Top speed determined to be 270kph before the engine suffered catastrophic failure; it was determined the engine merely stretched to its new size, making vital components thinner and weaker.

Note: Dang. Bet that thing would have been a blast to drive. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0569
Name: Researcher Lombardi
Date: 13/04/2019
Total items: Two steel horseshoes, one winning scratch lottery ticket, one ceramic Maneki-Neko statue

Note: Just got released from medical observation. I got to experience the joy of being trampled by what felt like every damn skip in this facility. I was on my way to the testing chamber yesterday when apparently they all managed to breach containment at the same time. Hurts like hell but just a few broken ribs, thankfully. This whole turn of events has got me thinking about luck - was it bad luck getting trampled or good luck surviving? Can 914 produce something that would alter it? Even the smallest nudge might be able to start a virtuous cycle in terms of its output. - Lombardi

Input: One steel horseshoe
Setting: 1:1
Output: One steel tennis shoe
Note: That would make for an interesting piece of art. The tricky thing here is the more overt 'lucky' objects like four-leaf clovers or a rabbit's foot are biological. - Lombardi

Input: One horseshoe, one winning scratch lottery ticket, one ceramic Maneki-Neko statue
Setting: Fine
Output: One steel four-leaf clover. Each leaf of the clover is inset with a ceramic plate with paper ornamentation.

Input: Output of the previous test
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A 500 ml syringe. The plunger and needle are made of steel while the body is made of translucent ceramics. On the side of the syringe is a control panel consisting of a steel switch and a paper label. The switch has two settings - red and green. When used on a living being, the syringe will extract some amount of an unknown liquid matching the selected color. The liquid evaporates instantly when exposed to air. True functionality of this object is not yet understood but is suspected to be used for extracting and injecting 'luck' between living beings. SCP classification is underway.

Note: The size of this needle is extremely intimidating. Almost all the D-class we've tested it on so far have fainted just looking at it. The working theory is that the red setting is for extracting bad luck, and the green setting is for good luck - based on the fact that D's have plenty of red, and very little green. We're still determining a safe way to test this - concentrating a bunch of bad luck or good luck in a D-class seems like a containment breach waiting to happen. - Lombardi

Note: The sheer volume of potential tests that I've started to brainstorm after reading about that syringe is going to keep me up all night. I should really not think about trying to refine physical 'luck' even further using 914 or trying to use an insanely lucky person to operate 914. Nothing good can come of that, except whatever happens to said person. Wait… can there be such a thing as a luck overdose? Questions for later… -Larua

Test 914-0570
Name: Researcher Z. Larua
Date: 13/04/2019
Total Items: 1 note, 1 pencil

Note: I was going to test to see what this machine had an affinity for, but I was informed I already performed it. Dr. Veritas also told me not to do it again. Sternly. So instead of the prior test, let's examine what this machine is incompatible with. -Larua

Input: 1 note that reads "What do you wish to avoid, 914?", 1 pencil
Setting: 1:1
Output: A pencil that is completely worn all the way down to the eraser head, and one note that seems to be completely coated in graphite. Upon closer inspection with a microscope, the paper has the phrase "17 Again" written continuously from corner to corner on the front and back. When viewed at a certain angle in light, the shading on the graphite seems to display the name "NUKEA".

Note: I'm afraid to ask. -Larua

Note: Well, sorry. I have too many copies of 17 again. -Nukea

Test 914-0571
Name: Junior Researcher Kenwol

Total items: 1 sharpie, 1 post-it note

Note: I've seen people basically communicating with this machine, so I thought I'd give it a try - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Input: 1 note that has written on it "What do you think of me?", 1 sharpie
Setting: 1:1
Output: A post-it note with a drawing of Junior Researcher Kenwol drawn on it, 1 sharpie

Test 914-0572
Name: Dr. Nukea
Date: 13/04/2019
Total items: Three copies of 17 again

Input: A copy of 17 again
Setting: 1:1
Output: Pokemon, the First Movie

Note: Oh I get it. Ash stays young. Clever. -Nukea

Input: A copy of 17 again
Setting: Fine
Output: A video game for the Nintendo Wii. The game is called “17 again” the game.

Note: Shovelware, as expected -Nukea

Input: A copy of 17 again
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A movie called “Hilarious Tests of 914 found on r/SCP.” The movie refers to the social media website Reddit. However, no instance of an r/SCP subreddit is known to exist.

Note: Weird, I found some of my tests on it. -Nukea.

Test 914-0573
Name: Probationary Researcher Darby
Date: 13/04/2019
Total Items: One Twenty-three page peace treaty covering any possible situation, One Pen

Note: Maybe 914 will accept this - Researcher Darby

Input: Above Mentioned
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Signed Peace Treaty

Note: Does this mean that 914 will stop trying to kill me? - Researcher Darby

Note: Researcher Darby was found nearly dead this morning after the Peace Treaty he signed transformed into a paper assassin and attempted to kill him. He was found by security personnel bleeding out, covered in papercuts, and suffering from poison derived from the Ink. The assassin has not yet been found and guards equipped with water guns have been assigned to Researcher's Darby, Calloway, Nukea, Wren, Stan, Lombardi and any other Researcher that has had negative interactions with 914 within the past 6 months. - Security Chief Brandt

Note: My porcelain cat mug got it. I think it rolled over spilling the tea I had in it and then shredded it with its claws. I found the paper assassin's head and torso struggling to get out of the cat mug's mouth. I was going to rip it up and incinerate it but the cat ate it. If it weren't for the fact that that cat has shown nothing but kindness towards people, I would get rid of it. -Intern Lunar

Test 914-0574
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 13/04/2019
Total Items: Five pump-pressurized water rifles.

Notes: Time to see if I'm on 914's hit list. -Prof. Wren

Input: All 5 rifles.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 water cannon, equivalent in mass to the 5 rifles. Outfitted with a buttstock, a 24-liter water tank, and a barrel 3 inches in diameter. An anomalous property causes it to automatically pressurize its water tank when the trigger is held halfway down, to a maximum of 165psi after 4 seconds. At maximum pressure, the entire tank load is discharged in a single "Cannonball" shot clocked at up to 132km/h; upon impact, the "cannonball" explodes over a 6-meter radius. Nicknamed "H2O-9000" by Prof. Wren after the similarly-named weapon from the DOOM video game franchise.

Note: I'll take that as a no. Permission to keep this on my person until Darby's latest mistake is found, boss? -Prof. Wren

Note: The mug cat found it - Intern Lunar

Test 914-0575
Name: Junior Researcher Kenwol
Date: 14/04/2019
Total Items: 1 slip of paper

Input: 1 slip of paper with the words "Please don't assassinate me"
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 slip of paper that reads "Who", that when read, every other word spoken or written, becomes "who"

Note: I who to who it who fine - Junior Who Kenwol

Note: Junior Researcher Kenwol was later found putting the paper in the incinerator, saying "Who"

Note: I don't… someone get the Site Psychiatrist of Amnestics specialist for Kenwol, he's doing… something he's not supposed to do. -Veritas

Test 914-0576
Name: Dr. Piedmont
Date: 14/04/2019
Total Items: 1 paper, 1 pencil

Note: I'm back from my break, and am going to exercise much more caution when dealing with 914 now, seriously. - Dr. Piedmont

Input: 1 blank sheet of paper and a pencil
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A sheet of paper with the ten most recent 914 tests written on it in cursive handwriting. No changes to the results are present.

Note: Strange, usually this would be a prime opportunity for 914 to create some horrific cognitohazard. I'm considering myself lucky. - Dr. Piedmont

Note: "Going to exercise much more caution when dealing with 914 now, seriously" Puts paper and a pencil in 914 on very fine. Excuse me sir, but how does that work? -Intern Lunar

Note: Yeah, glad we don't have another paper assassin running around stabbing people with a pencil. -R. Luke

Test 914-0577
Name: Maintenance Technician Johnson
Date: 14/04/2019
Total Items: Three ordinary bricks, Three plastic turnips

Note: As I'm somehow still alive after that breach, I've decided to do a test with 914 to see if that will calm down my frazzled nerves. I admit to being a little confused as to why everything pretty much ignored me, as well as why I have a guard with a water gun following me around, but whatever.

Input: One brick, One plastic turnip
Setting: 1:1
Output: One brick turnip sculpture with green and white plastic leaves

Note: It's a bricky turnip. I was expecting a brick-shaped turnip and/or a turnip-shaped brick. I guess I kind of got both. - MT Johnson

Input: One brick, One plastic turnip
Setting: Fine
Output: One brick wrapped in a thin layer of plastic. Viewing the brick causes the viewer to contemplate the probable taste of the object

Note: There's no compulsion to actually try to take a bite out of it, per se, but it is weird to suddenly start wondering what it would taste like. - MT Johnson

Input: One brick, One plastic turnip
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One green plastic plant embedded in a "pot" made out of brick. The area directly around the plant has been seared black in place of soil, and the plant grows when any liquid form of plastic is poured on the "soil".

Note: It's a plastic turnip plant that wilts when you don't water it with plastic. I would recommend using polyurethane, as it's relatively inexpensive. - MT Johnson

Note: I've been busy lately repairing the messes that Calloway and Darby keep causing, but I'll try to get around to doing more tests, as the results are always interesting. - MT Johnson

Test 914-0578
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 14/04/2019
Total Items: One xylophone, One 5-piece set of tuning forks each tuned to 88.01 Hertz.

Note: It's been a while since I've done any tests involving acoustics. Figured it might help soothe the nerves after Darby's latest mess. Given this will be a Very Fine test I've advised the test area be cleared in case we wind up with some sort of musical scorpion kaiju. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 xylophone, 5 tuning forks.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A "tree" of 5 metal rings, measuring 0.33m-1m in diameter, with 12 pieces of wood of varying lengths connected along the edge pointing towards, and connecting the rings so, the center shaft. Touching a piece of wood produces 1 of 60 distinct, ethereal tones for as long as it is touched. No other anomalous properties found.

Note: This is….wow. This is beautiful. Can you guys give me a few minutes with this, please? -Prof. Wren

Note: After practicing with the instrument for approximately 12 minutes, Prof. Wren went on to play a cover of Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" and Sting's "Desert Rose" on it. Audio recordings have been made available for site personnel.

Test 914-0579
Name: Jr. Researcher Stan
Date: 14/04/2019
Total Items: One 24-inch LCD TV, connected to a VHS player and battery. Player contains a VHS tape of a ten-year-old football game.

Note: Found an old VHS player and high school football tape in my attic. I don't recognize the school at all and the announcer was obnoxiously loud. Decided to plug it into a TV and send it through. Also, I wasn't the only one seeing the guards holding water guns yesterday, was I? -Stan

Input: Above items
Setting: Fine
Output: TV, VHS player, and battery were unchanged. Program playing on the tape is a golf game that doesn't appear to have ever happened. The football announcer provided commentary throughout the game in a loud voice.

Note: I'm not sure if it was the announcer or the gameplay, but that was a really intense game of golf. Put the tape in the breakroom if someone ever feels the need to watch intense golf. On a side note, five bucks says that Lunar's cat mug ends up spilling tea on his computer. -Jr. Researcher Stan

Note: 10 that it doesn't - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Note: 20 Kuwaiti dinars (65.779 USD) that it does. And if it doesn't, Stan, I'll pay for your lunch for the rest of the week. -Dr. Cleveland

Note: WHAT? Is it not supposed to destroy things on Rough? - Janitor Svede

Tests 2-68 Removed for Brevity

Note: Maybe if I try on another setting it will work - Janitor Svede

Input: 1 Mug Cat
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 Mug Cat, patterned differently from input

Note: Janitor Svede was found crying in a corner moaning about "Mug Cats" and "The Gears were laughing at me". He has been sent to psychological counseling and reassigned to a different section of the facility. - Site Director Hackett

Note: I oversee a testing department consisting of blubbering petty children and clumsy disasters in the shape of research personnel. I don't get paid enough for this crap. -Veritas

Note: You get paid plenty, Lucius. Plus, I let you yell at them all you want. You can't buy that kind of stress reliever. - Site Director Hackett

Note: Touche. - Veritas

Note: Don't steal my mug cat, please. Its claws are comparable to ceramic knives. I've lost several mouse pads to its claws. Also, don't cry over spilt liquids. -Inter Lunar

The following experiment was not authorized. Dr. Malachite was in psychiatric care prior to escaping 26 hours ago.

Test 914-0581
Name: Dr. Malachite, D-1714-A6
Date: 14/04/2019
Total Items: One quart refined gasoline from a previous experiment, 1 bottle of sriracha, 1 blowtorch.

Input: Gasoline, sriracha, blowtorch, Dr. Malachite.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Dr. Malachite, now made of pure combustion and roughly 2.5 meters tall.

Note: D-class terminated by Dr. Malachite via incineration. Dr. Malachite went on a 4-minute monologue about "cleansing the Earth in holy fire" before being terminated by Security Officer Deegan via the "H2O-9000" from one of Prof. Wren's earlier tests; a single "cannon blast" from it fully extinguished the doctor, leaving only a pair of smoldering skeletons. No damage to 914 reported. Security Officer Deegan treated for minor injuries after being propelled into a wall by the recoil of the water cannon.

Note: Yowza…and to think I was planning on shooting Darby with that thing when he got back. -Prof. Wren

Note: Remind me to give you and Deegan a raise when I renew your contracts. -Veritas

Test 914-0582
Name: Dr. Cleveland, D-1618
Date: 15/04/2019
Total Items: One photo of Soviet Chairman Andrei Gromyko (dated 1972), documents pertaining to Dr. Alto Clef (dated 2001), one generic 4GB USB containing security footage of SCP-914 from 1st to 7th January 2019

Input: Security footage
Setting: Fine
Output: One SanDisk 8GB USB containing a copy of The Empire Strikes Back. Viewing showed that all actors are replaced by people who were present in the original tape that day, even if only briefly so.
Notably, deceased personnel Junior Researcher Altdamm and the entity resembling Girls Frontline character Grizzly MkV played the parts of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker respectively; while Dr. Cleveland, Junior Researcher Stan, Researcher Reis, and Dr. Veritas played the parts for Lando Calrissian, Han Solo, Leia Organa, and Yoda respectively.
Several scenes were also altered, including the "Luke, I am your father" scene, where the entity ("Luke") shot Researcher Altdamm ("Vader") before letting itself fall into the Millennium Falcon.
When interviewed, no personnel had any recollection of being in the film. The item has no anomalous effects and has been placed in the break room.

Note: To see Altdamm shout "No, I am your commander" at Grizzly feels oddly satisfying… Also, Dr. Nukea, any plans for a film night whatsoever? - Cleveland

Note: Outside of my testing area, you discuss this. -Veritas

Note: Who am I in the film? Someone good who doesn't die? - Researcher Darby

Note: I will never forget the fact that 914 thought me fit to be Han Solo. I'm honored, even if I don't look like him. At all. - Stan

Note: Darby, apparently you are Boba Fett. And in case you're guessing, Site Director Hackett played Palpatine. Also, some of the names of the characters have changed to reflect their gender. In fact Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa had their first names reversed. I didn't notice that until the credits rolled. - Cleveland

Input: Photo of Andrei Gromyko, documents pertaining to Dr. Clef
Setting: Fine
Output: Two items:
1. Documents pertaining to Andrei Gromyko's tenure as Permanent Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations, with two handwritten words reading "Grim Grom". This item has no anomalous effects.
2. One photo of Dr. Clef, with his face unobstructed. When D-1618 retrieved this item, she immediately fell into a coma upon seeing Dr. Clef's face. When awoken, D-1618 could no longer recognize any faces except that of her own or of Dr. Clef. She has subsequently been diagnosed with prosopagnosia. This item has been labeled as a cognitohazard and has been placed into secure storage.

Note: Fortunately that wasn't me. I see why we needed bodyguards with water guns now. Alas, sorry, D-1618. -Cleveland

Setting: Fine
Output: 1 scale model of a Star Wars thermal detonator One functioning thermal detonator from Star Wars.

Note: Oh God no - Dr. Matism

Note: Matism, you still have to activate the thing to actually get it to go off. On a separate note, you're a complete idiot for even trying to use a hand grenade and lucky to be alive. Try that again and your testing privileges are out the window, provided you survive. -Veritas

Test 914-0586
Name: Dr. Piedmont
Date: 15/04/2019
Total Items: 5 flash drives containing every SCP document Dr. Piedmont has access to

Input: Aforementioned flash drive
Setting: Rough
Output: A flash drive containing a database where every SCP is either Researcher Darby or Researcher Calloway; however, SCP-048's entry is blank

Input: Flash drive containing SCPs
Setting: Coarse
Output: A flash drive containing information about every single SCP Dr. Piedmont has access to except they're all on one text file and there little to no spaces between SCP entries

Note: It hurts - Dr. Piedmont

Input: Flash drive containing SCPs
Setting: 1:1
Output: A flash drive containing information about SCPs that the foundation does not have in containment. The leading theory onto what these SCPs are is that they are SCPs from a different dimension.

Input: Flash drive containing SCPs
Setting: Fine
Output: A flash drive containing every SCP's information.

Note: Dr. Piedmont and any personnel that were in the testing chamber at that time were administered Class A amnestics shortly after the test was concluded.

Input: Flash drive containing SCPs
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A flash drive containing a database where every SCP is SCP-914 except for SCP-682, who has been replaced with Researcher Calloway and Researcher Darby. Every test log has been replaced with the 914 test logs except for the 682 termination logs, which have been replaced with every test from 914 where Darby or Calloway have been severely injured. SCP-914's actual entry has been severely edited to include either false or new information that is most likely false about SCP-914.

Note: That was…very interesting. Maybe I should test more with these. - Dr. Piedmont

Test 914-0587
Name: Researcher Z. Larua
Date: 15/04/2019
Total Items: 5 car batteries, 5 tire irons, 5 scalpels

Input: 1 battery, 1 tire iron, 1 scalpel
Setting: Rough
Output: Melted chunks of plastic and scraps of metal

Input: 1 battery, 1 tire iron, 1 scalpel
Setting: Coarse
Output: 1 plastic lead-lined bowl filled with battery acid. A stack of metal 'straw' with a needle hidden in it.

Input: 1 battery, 1 tire iron, 1 scalpel
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 car battery casing filled with Duracell AA batteries, jumper cables, and a skinning knife.

Input: 1 battery, 1 tire iron, 1 scalpel
Setting: Fine
Output: A car battery with a mechanical arm holding a scalpel attached to the top. There is a button on top of the arm that, when pressed, causes the arm to horizontally orient itself in the direction of the button press and perform a single stab. When multiple people press the button individually, the arm will 'queue' the inputs and attempt to stab in the directions of the order of inputs. Should at any point more than three people queue inputs or all participants press the button simultaneously, the arm will extend fully at its current position and begin rotating clockwise at ████ RPM for ██ seconds.

Note: Since the device was outfitted with a regular scalpel, I gave all testing D-Class stab-proof vests. I wasn't expecting a fan of death with that last experiment, however. The janitor and MTF supply officer were not happy with me. -Larua

Input: 1 battery, 1 tire iron, 1 scalpel
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A metallic telescopic baton with a button on the handle. When the button is pressed, the baton expands and becomes electrified. An anomalous magnetic field forms from the electricity that then creates a 'case' for a currently unknown corrosive substance to fill. This corrosive substance is emitted from small 'pores' on the baton and remains in place regardless of what the baton strikes. Striking a low-density object causes the baton to phase clean through it and cut it like a knife. Striking a high-density object causes the baton to bounce off and leave a small burn/melt mark. The baton can still be used against high-density objects by pressing it up against the object and maintaining contact. This will cause the baton to melt through the object continuously at a rate proportional to the density of said object. It is observed that no corrosive residue is created during contact with an object, and all of the corrosive substance is completely retracted into the device when the button is pressed again. Researching the substance at the moment is virtually impossible.

Note: It's a gross lightsaber. I'm getting alarmed at how readily 914 is producing deadly, accident-prone weaponry for us. The rate seems to be increasing. - Lombardi

Note: That or the collective IQ of all of us is decreasing. -Intern Lunar

Note: I think it "knows" something that we don't - Dr. Matism

Note: At least your actions haven't had casualties equal to the population of a small country - Researcher Darby

Note: Give it a few years, Darby. - Veritas

Test 914-0588
Name: Dr. Matism

Items: One 8 meter strand of hempen rope.

Note: I'm going for an unbreakable rope

Input: The 8 meters of rope
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A hempen ambush noose. When approached by a human, it lunges at them in an attempt to wrap itself around its neck and strangle them.

Note: Dr. Matism has been hospitalized due to a ruptured airpipe. Object incinerated by orders of Facility Manager ███████.

Note: It's official, this skip doesn't like me - Dr. Matism

Note: Your power of deduction is shocking. - Veritas

Test 914-0589
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 15/04/2019
Total Items: One 8-meter strand of hempen rope, one katana.

Note: I'm testing Dr. Matism's hypothesis on his relationship with 914 while simultaneously seeing if using the same inputs with the same settings can yield different results. Textbook definition of insanity, I know, but what isn't with this thing? -Prof. Wren

Input: The rope.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A hempen chihuahua. The dog lunged at, and bit down on, Prof. Wren's ankle upon approach; it fell to the floor and went inert upon being slashed to pieces. Further testing revealed the rope no longer contained any anomalous properties. Rope incinerated as a precautionary measure.

Note: And that's what the katana was for. Not sure how this bodes with Dr. Matism's hypothesis, though. I mean, this wouldn't be the first time 914's attacked me (see footage of IKEA experiment for details… and laughs), but it could just be that 914 saw the same stuff as before and responded as if it were the same tester? Maybe 914 just doesn't like hemp? Either way, don't think I'm gonna be doing a three-peat of that experiment. -Prof. Wren

I [EXPLETIVE] hate chihuahuas. Soulless bastards - Dr. Matism

Note: If he can bring a Katana to work can I bring weapons to defend myself? - Researcher Darby

Note: You're a walking disaster as it is, Darby. Wren didn't get his PhD slashing everything resembling danger up. You should be glad that Hackett took pity on you and you're not in Antarctica right now. - Veritas

Note: Perks of being on good terms with security, Darby, even if I did have to file some paperwork to get clearance for it…and agree to let them keep the H2O-9000. They'll probably get better use out of it anyway, especially for fire control situations. EDIT: By the way… "He?" "His?" I would have thought the C-cups were a giveaway. Ah well. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0590
Name: Researcher Z. Larua
Date: 15/04/2019
Total Items: 5 pairs of ice skates

Input: 1 pair of ice skates
Setting: Rough
Output: Scraps of leather, metal, and plastic

Input: 1 pair of ice skates
Setting: Coarse
Output: Strips of leather and plastic. The skate blades have been split vertically into paper-thin sheets of metal that retains the original shape.

Input: 1 pair of ice skates
Setting: 1:1
Output: A pair of ice skate boots, but the skate blades have been replaced with mini-skis.

Input: 1 pair of ice skates
Setting: Fine
Output: A pair of speed skates (ice skates with longer, thinner blades). When worn by a human, the skates produce an anomalous effect where the blades are completely immune to friction. This allows the wearer to 'skate' on almost any kind of floor. However, due to the skates themselves being immune to friction, the wearer must use outside force (pushing on a wall, being pushed, etc.) to start movement. The wearer must also stop themselves using similar methods. Any action that disconnects the skates from the ground will also dissipate all momentum, such as jumping or falling. Attempting to brake using the skates will result in the skates continuing movement in the direction of the wearer's turned feet.

Note: As hilarious as it is to watch a D-Class get rag-dolled into a wall trying to brake, I see plenty of research that can be done on such an object. -Larua

Input: 1 pair of ice skates
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A single elongated rod of metal, roughly 1 meter in length and 1 inch in diameter. The rod itself is completely anomalous in the fact that it is entirely immune to friction as if it was in a vacuum. Only when something biological touches the rod, will friction function normally. Once someone lets go of the rod, it will stay perfectly still in the exact position that it was released, even in the air. Should it be spun while released, the rod will remain spinning mid-air until another biological being touches it.

Note: Did 914 just produce an object that is capable of perpetual motion? If this is indeed the case, this object could revolutionize energy based science on a global scale! Now if only we were capable of replicating……damn it. That's not going to happen ever. Regardless, I'd like to request permission to begin a research project for potential application of this object into this Site's energy structure. This should improve our base, or at very least, provide some form of backup power should the output be negligible. -Larua

Note: You know the drill, Larua. Keep it, but if it explodes or happens to accelerate the heat death of the universe, it's your ass on the line, not mine. - Veritas

Total Items: 1 iPod Touch (2009 edition)

Note: Curious to see what 914 does with this. Worst case scenario I get rid of an old piece of… well, actually, I shouldn't say that. There's no telling what the worst case scenario here might be. -Prof. Wren

Input: The iPod Touch.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A metal plate with clear plastic coating, matching the size specs of the panel for 914's setting dial. The "settings" listed read "Smash to bits," "Disassemble and sort," "Swap with something else," "Imp█ovemen█s," and "Pl█y Go█ at █ou█ o█n p██il, m████a█." There are no holes for inserting a dial or otherwise connecting it to 914, making it useless as a replacement part.

Note: This actually seems like an accurate description of 914's settings. I think that last part reads "Play God at your own peril, mortal." I recommend keeping this as a training tool, Dr. Veritas. -Prof. Wren

Note: Sounds good. -Veritas

Test 914-0598
Name: Dr. Piedmont
Date: 16/04/2019
Total Items: Two handwritten notes, two pens.

Note: Testing a theory similar to Dr. Matism and Prof. Wren's. Got the idea after reading through some of their logs, and noticing all of Researcher Darby and Calloway's experiments have progressively gotten more dangerous. - Dr. Piedmont

Input: One note with the words "The more that a person uses SCP-914, the more likely it is that the output of their experiment will be negative" written on it. One pen.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An edited note, on the back side it reads "X ⋅ Theta Prime - 914 = DR". A pen is laid on top of the note. Investigation into the significance and meaning of each symbol is ongoing

Note: I have to be onto something right? Or maybe 914 is just toying with me. I'm going to test it one more time - Dr. Piedmont

Input: One note with the same sentence written on it, one pen.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A piece of paper with the anomalous property of inflicting deep cuts on whoever comes into contact with it. Dr. Piedmont sustained heavy injuries upon picking the paper up, and was sent to the sites medical ward shortly after the test concluded.

Note: I'm going to research this in my own time, any discovery I make I'll share with other members of staff. - Dr. Piedmont

Note: After further investigation, the deep cuts aren't actually real. The output was a cognitohazard that makes anyone coming into contact with it think that they're injured. Incinerated. Piedmont is currently undergoing anti-memetic treatment. -Veritas

Test 914-0599
Name: Researcher Z. Larua
Date: 16/04/2019
Total Items: Ice skates

I honestly really want to see if I can get another one of those perpetual motion rods. -Larua

Input: One pair of ice skates
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A single rod of metal, about 1 meter in length and 0.5 meters in diameter. When a D-Class was sent in to retrieve the rod, a blast of steam shot out from all openings on their uniform the moment they touched the rod. Once the steam dissipated, all was that was left was a completely dehydrated corpse. It is assumed that D-Class expired instantly upon touching the rod. Hazard personnel were called to retrieve the rod. Upon examination, the metal was revealed to be pure potassium with anomalous properties. Any water that touches the metal, the water will instantly vaporize instead of the potassium reacting. Should any biological entity touch the rod, all water within them will instantly vaporize without causing any physical damage to the body.

Note: That went horribly…for that D-Class. This rod however will give me yet more interesting research to perform. I'm just happy that 914 didn't output some kind of other anomalous alkali metal that would've literally exploded in my face. I wonder how well this potassium rod would work against 682? -Larua

Note: DON'T. From what I can tell, we don't want a contact-killing 682 from that. -Intern Lunar

Note: Well, it already kills everything in its path - Dr. Matism

Note: I just realized that 682 is the SCP version of Kirby - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Note: A VERY ANGRY Kirby no less. -Intern Lunar

Test 914-0600
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 17/04/2019
Total Items: One large rock (granite)

Input: One rock
Setting: Fine
Output: An object consisting of two quartz wheels attached to a rectangular stone base. Object is capable of movement, and moves quickly in an apparently random trajectory. It is not presumed to be sentient.

Note: It’s like the sphere from earlier except it never stops moving. Can someone make a hamster wheel for this thing? -Cho

Note: I'll get a hamster ball, but I get 50% of the power royalty's when I turn it into a generator - Researcher Darby

Note: After being hooked up to a makeshift generator (without my permission, might I add) the thing started slowing down. It only seems to move when it's not being resisted by something stronger than air. - Veritas

Test 914-0601
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 17/04/2019
Total Items: One generic empty 1TB USB, with the word "Europe" printed on.

Input: USB
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One generic 4TB USB, with the word "Pogrom" printed on. It contains a program, which if run on any computer using any Linux-based or Linux-derived system, would instantly cause it to shut down permanently by deletion of all critical software components.

Note: If my memory served me correctly, SCP OS is at least partially based upon Linux. And by partially, I mean 15 percent of the source code is clearly based on Linux, just slightly more derivative than iOS. Requesting permission to test this USB on an offline, standalone computer using SCP OS. If it is indeed Linux-derived, we would know. - Cleveland

Note: Yeah, let me know how you're going to convince Rosen to give you anything. - Veritas

Note: After Engelhart made such a mess? Well, I'm not expecting any computer virus testing permits for the month. Veritas, consider that request retracted. And I would absolutely agree with your verdict there. - Cleveland

Test 914-0602
Name: Dr. Engelhart
Date: 17/04/2019
Total items: 5 pencils, each with different designs.

Note: it's about time I cleaned out some junk from my desk. - Engelhart

Input: A Valentine's themed pencil covered in heart print.
Setting: Rough
Output: Two puddles of red and white paint, a pile of sawdust, a small pile of flakes of eraser, and a small disk of what is confirmed to be graphite.

Input: A pencil designed for St. Patrick's day, designed with four leaf clover print.
Setting: Coarse
Output: A approximately 1/2 centimeter tall, 1 1/2 centimeter wide, and 20 centimeter long slab of wood covered in different greens. Underneath the slab was a thin layer of graphite.

Input: A pencil designed in the pattern of a candy cane.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A pencil with a pattern of Santas on it, except the Santas are printed in red and white.

Input: A pencil with print resembling a rocket.
Setting: Fine
Output: a small explosion after viewing security footage it was realized the pencil was upright with the small explosion helping it generate enough lift to go through SCP-914 and go through the walls to be launched into orbit. Pencil was eventually retrieved and found to have no other anomalous properties.

Input: A pencil with several cats printed onto it.
Setting: Very fine.
Output: OwO A compweetwee nwomwal pwencwil UwU. An identical pencil to the original physically, but has the memetic property to make writers write using excessive furry slang without realizing it.

Note: Really? Picking up a similar looking object after using very fine on it? You might just be Calloway 2.0 at this point. - Veritas

Note: At least he didn't drink it, or anything else - Researcher Darby

Note: How do you drink a pencil? -Intern Lunar

Test 914-0603
Name: Dr. Engelhart
Date: 17/04/2019
Total Items: A virus used by the Foundation to hack anomalous websites, stored in a USB.

Note: I want to see what it could do to improve an already high quality virus, and what it thinks actually could be improved. - Engelhart

Input: Above mentioned USB
Setting: Fine
Output: Once plugged into a computer, there are no changes of note until 5 minutes in, when every website last visited in the last 24 hours abruptly shuts down. This effect has lasted from 5 minutes, up to 10 months.

Note: What did I really expect from SCP-914 honestly. Whelp, goodbye Reddit. - Dr. Engelhart

Note: DAMN YOU VIRUS, it killed my favorite game site. - Researcher Darby

Note: Excuse me? Every page from Wikipedia and Wikileaks, to Deviantart and Pixiv, to CNN and KMBC 9 News, all the way to Steam, Twitter, Apple Inc., and even two of our internal network servers got shut down within ten minutes of that experiment. I was told that Site Director Hackett threw an entire experiment log folder across the room after he heard the news. Consider yourself lucky that there were no severe containment breaches during the two hours when our network servers went down (and Site-17 was still cleaning up the mess caused by an SCP-953 containment breach attempt). Engelhart, you better fix this mess, fast. And don't expect Veritas to not revoke your testing permits. - Cleveland

Note: Damn it Engelhart, I have Hackett yelling at me from one line and Rosen from another. I don't know what the hell you did, but you're washing dishes and cleaning testing areas until either your hair turns grey or some skip puts you out of your misery! -Veritas

Note: This just came in. Thanks to Engelhart's computer virus, two more containment breaches occurred within the first three hours. One of SCP-4560 in Site-64; and another of SCP-1591 in Site-79. While the former only affected one individual (a D-class, no less); a systems failure in the latter caused the fallen star to brighten by 67.1 million lux, in addition to causing the disintegration of 23 personnel, five of which were research doctors. To quote Director Edgar Holman of Site-64, "We're buried under a ████load of troubles." - Cleveland

Test 914-0604
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 17/04/2019

Note: Bunny! -Jane Cho

Test 914-0605
Name: Researcher Lombardi
Date: 17/04/2019
Input: Three sets of wooden chopsticks.

Note: I've successfully petitioned for the opportunity to test 914 with operators that are under the influence of various substances. In order to minimize variables, we are going to repeatedly test the same input item with a single D-Class, D-138840, who has a history of drug related charges. We're not doing multi-substance tests just yet, necessitating a waiting period of a few days to allow the previous substances to work their way out of D-138840's system.

Note: D-class have a tendency to be rowdy even while sober, so we're including some enhanced security measures. Two additional guards will escort the D-Class during the entire testing procedure. D-138840 will be operating 914 by themselves, but in a specific order to ensure that no-one ends up in the input chamber. 1 - Place item in the input booth. 2 - Set the desired refinement level. 3 - Wind the key. As soon as 914 begins processing, the D-Class will be removed from the testing area. - Lombardi

Note: Today we're testing with alcohol - Lombardi

Input: One set of wooden chopsticks
Setting: 1:1
D-138840 BAC: .00
Output: One wooden knife equal in mass to both chopsticks

Input: One set of wooden chopsticks
Setting: 1:1
D-138840 BAC: .16
Output: Two 'attempted' wooden eating utensils. Each one is half-spoon and half-fork, divided down the middle.

Note: D-138840 at this point began showing difficulty following instruction and attempted to insert flatulence into the input booth. No reaction occurred as key had not yet been wound. Testing paused for 10 minutes to ensure no input contamination. - Lombardi

Input: One set of wooden chopsticks
Setting: Very Fine
D-138840 BAC: .16
Output: One set of wooden chopsticks. Chopsticks display an anomalous physical property wherein the inertia of each stick is roughly 10 times greater while at rest. Operating these chopsticks for grasping items has proven incredibly difficult.

Note: Imagine something suspended in a non-Newtonian fluid, but with reverse properties, and you start to approach what these feel like. - Lombardi

Test 914-0606
Name: Researcher Festiv
Date: 17/04/2019
Items: Two water guns, 250ml vial of good luck, 250ml vial of bad luck

Note: Ok so we know just refining luck is a bad idea. But what happens when we put the luck in with something else? Will it get used and give us a better output? I'll be performing this with the water guns because let's face it: there's too many paper inputs that could turn into a murder mess. Looking at you, Cleveland.

Note: Very funny, Festiv. It's not like I'm the only one inputting papers. Though I'll agree; everything has a risk. At least I'm not a walking disaster like Darby or Engelhart. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: Yeah I'd think fetish fiction has a bit more than risk there. And on very fine? Last thing we need is a cannibal paper humanoid beheading us. -Researcher Festiv

Input: One water gun, 250ml of good luck
Setting: Fine
Output: One water sniper, it resembles a ████ brand sniper rifle. capable of firing 5 concentrated shots up to 200M away at 20M per second, the vial is used as a lens for the water gun.

Input: One water gun, 250ml of bad luck
Setting: Fine
Output: One water gun. the stream falls to the ground at 2 meters, the vial has been turned into a glass ball inside of 914 that sometimes blocks the pump.

Note: Ok good we have a viable weapon against the paper beasts 914 outputs sometimes. This thing can also puncture weak/brittle materials so most dangerous outputs can easily be dealt with without harming 914. -Researcher Festiv

Test 914-0607
Name: Dr. Nukea & Dr. Tamsen
Date: 17/04/2019

Input: 1 shirt.
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of shredded cotton, equal in mass to the shirt.

Input: 1 shirt.
Setting: Coarse
Output: A ball of wound cotton strand, equal in mass to the shirt.

Input: 1 shirt.
Setting: 1:1
Output: 3 plain white cotton T-shirts, size 3X-Small.

Note: Huh. Could be a nice present for a baby shower, I suppose. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 shirt.
Setting: Fine
Output: Same shirt, but now with a logo printed on it via lightly-singed cotton. The logo reads "I Survived The Darbypocalypse And All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt."

Note: Testing had to be suspended for 5 minutes due to uncontrollable laughter on the part of Prof. Wren and several other staff members present at the time. Laughter was determined not to be caused by any anomalous properties of the shirt.

Note: "Darbypocalypse"? Im not that dangerous or destructive, right? - Researcher Darby

Input: 1 shirt.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: [DATA EXPUNGED]

Note: MTF-28 successfully destroyed the anomalous shirt. Witnessing personnel were administered class-C amnestics afterwards as a precautionary measure. Full report of this experiment classified and limited to O5 personnel only.

Note: Wow. Glad I decided to read today's reports before attempting this experiment… again, apparently. Definitely explains the headache. -Prof. Wren

Input: Above mentioned items.
Setting: Fine
Output: A USB with a plastic casing, discovered to be the same mass as the vial, and a post it note with a cognitohazardous symbol that causes the viewer to be convinced that they’re being eaten by SCP-682. When the USB is plugged in, it recovers all afflicted websites, exept it only works for 5-300 minutes, and then the websites all shut down again.

Note: Since this is your fault, you’re on recovery duty - Veritas

Note: Still better than being eaten by 682. - Engelhart

Note: Don't give me any ideas, I can think of worse. - Veritas

Note: I'm in. Have room for a dark elf rogue? - Dr. Matism

Note: [EXPLETIVE] yeah! - Dr. Engelhart

Note: Depends. Can I use the D6 that can roll a seven if I join in? - Dr. Beideman

Note: Sure, but -1 to a random stat if you use it - Dr. Engelhart

Note: Should we convince Veritas to join us? Also, can we make the round SCP-themed - Dr. Matism

Note: [EXPLETIVE] Yeah! Do you wanna go full SCP or just have an in game organization like this one? (P.S. no using the d20 that always rolls a 20) - Dr. Engelhart

Note: Don't worry, I lost them so there's no using them even if someone wanted to. - Junior Researcher Kenwol

Name: Dr. Matism
Date: 17/04/19
Total Items: One gas mask

Input: Gas Mask
Setting: Fine
Output: A gas mask that filters out all non-nitrogen based compounds.

Note: Wait, what? How is that an improvement? This is [EXPLETIVE] useless! Destroy this so nobody mistakes it for an actual gas mask. Or we could replace it with the one in Lucius's office. - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0615
Name: Dr. Matism
Date: 17/04/2019
Total Items: Dr. Matism's Jason mask

Note: I'm bored with this one

Input: Dr. Matism's mask
Setting: 1:1

Outputs 3 and 9: 2 pieces of paper with detailed drawings of the moon on them.
Output 10: A 2-page musical composition titled "The Beauties of Nature." It indicates it is to be played on the "tree xylophone" instrument produced in an earlier test.

Note: While I find the apparent pattern to the first 9 tests to be intriguing, the fact that it all stems from a singular source is quite interesting. In Japanese culture, 花鳥風月 ("Kachou Fugetsu," or "The Beauties of Nature") is written with the kanji for "flower," "bird," "wind," and "moon," and represents a popular artform in Japanese history. As for the music written here… Time to go see how this sounds. -Prof. Wren

Note: Prof. Wren has made a recording of the composition available for anyone who wishes to listen. She describes the piece as being "hauntingly mesmerizing."

Input: All of the previously mentioned items
Setting: Fine
Output: A Labs and SCPs 1e handbook.

Note: I did some reading, and turns out this is one huge insult. Here are some pre-made player excerpts.

Dr. Engelhart: An ignorant buffoon that can't for the love of God, cause a containment breach less than once per week. -3 to intelligence and -1 to wisdom. When rolling for any type of hazard they have x1.5 the chance to get it.
M.T. Johnson: A incredible hero to all of mankind and totally still deserves a pay raise. +10 to Strength +10 to Dexterity +10 to charisma +10 to intelligence +10 to wisdom and +10 to constitution. 0% chance for all hazards to reach this hero among men.
Dr. Calloway: An idiot that can't stop getting cognitohazards. Used to come to SCP-914 frequently but doesn't anymore due to past events there. Cannot enter 914's room because of this. -5 intelligence +1 constitution. Has a x2 chance to roll for a cognitohazard.

Note: I think you get the idea. Still a great game if you can get past the bias and tweak a few things to even it out. - Dr. Engelhart

Note: And then MT Johnson becomes an in-game Mary Sue. What could you expect? - Dr. Cleveland

Note: Am I in here, let's see, aha! 'Dr. Matism: A self conscious, blubbering moron whose own ego gets in the way of his judgement. +1 to intelligence, -1 to wisdom, and -1 strength. Has disadvantage on saving throws.' Wha- no, I'm way better than that! Go to hell 914! - Dr. Matism

Note: In the process of making me the best, 914 also made me totally unplayable. I see it's being just as helpful as always. - MT Johnson

Note: What am I on this? A Chaotic being with immense luck? - Researcher Darby

Note: Again, let me point you to comments I made earlier over 914's ''opinions''. - Veritas

Input: Ultron Unlimited (Avengers Volume 3 #19-22, 1999)
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One 1:644000 map of the world as of 2009, showing a reborn Soviet Union (as the Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics) with Riga as the capital, and a Gulf of New Amsterdam replacing much of Manhattan, Hudson County NJ, and Bergen County NJ, with what used to be Cresskill being noted as the deepest point of the Gulf.
Information gathered from the map showed that the United States was replaced by a military junta led by General Peter Pace after a violent overthrow of the HYDRA regime in 2006, itself a violent overthrow of the democratically elected George W. Bush government.
Of note was the markings of SCP Foundation sites across the world, indicating that the Foundation may exist in some form in this world.

Note: And there goes Alicia Keys, Jay-Z, and their Empire State of Mind… - D-1618

Test 914-0623
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 17/04/2019
Total Items: 20 pieces of sheet music paper, 1 vial of ink.

Note: After that composition it produced earlier, I'm curious to see what other kinds of music 914 can produce. -Prof. Wren

Input: The sheets, 20 ounces of ink from the vial.
Setting: Fine
Output: 2 pieces of paper with numerous slices, fold marks, and ink markings on them, appearing to mirror each other. When folded up as per the marks, they produce a pair of intricately detailed kirigami (a form of origami that allows for the paper to be cut) hands. Upon completion, both hands contracted into fists, extended their middle fingers, and produced a "raspberry" sound for 3 seconds before shredding themselves into pieces.

Note: Further experiments canceled as Prof. Wren stormed off in a huff with the remaining paper and ink, uttering multiple profanities on the way out.

Note: Tip of the day: 914 doesn't do the same nice thing twice in a row. - Dr. Engelhart

Note: This was probably the third time someone decided to make music out of 914. Probably the best result in terms of failure. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: 3rd time's the one that angers 914? -Intern lunar

Test 914-0624
Name: Physicist James Renwev, Jr. Researcher Ija Rasclon (transcribing).
Date: 18/04/2019
Items: One Hydrogen fuel cell, one paper detailing a proposed method of achieving aneutronic fusion.

Note: This is being written retroactively. Renwev conducted this test spontaneously during a minor breach of SCP-3199. Both the escaped instance of SCP-3199 and Renwev entered the room during the breach, whereupon Renwev conducted the test for defensive purposes. -Jr. Researcher Rasclon.

Input: See above.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A detonation which dented the output door of SCP-914, flash-blinded the instance of SCP-3199 and P. Renwev, and moderately injured Renwev. After this, water began condensing on the walls of the test chamber. A mangled, burnt combination of paper and metal was found in the output chamber.

Note: MTF arrived while the instance of 3199 was disoriented, and contained it. Current working theory is that 914 switched the paper of the research and the hydrogen in the fuel cell, causing a rapid rise in pressure which led to the hydrogen combusting. As a side note, has anyone created the SCP Foundation Darwin Awards yet? I have an entry. -Jr. Researcher Rasclon.

Note: I'm entering Calloway right off the bat. - Veritas

Note: It's a close call, but Xerial's Escapades of Evolutionary Expedition are just narrowly beaten by Ranwev trying to create nuclear fusion in 914. Let's all just be glad it can't do transmutation, or that might have worked. -JR. Rasclon.

Test 914-0625
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 18/04/2019
Total Items: 4 mantle rock samples (0.5kg each), a note reading "meow"

Input: 1 sample
Setting: Rough
Output: Peridotite dust

Input: 1 sample
Setting: Coarse
Output: 5 large peridot gemstones, dark-colored sand.

Input: 1 sample
Setting: 1:1
Output: Unaltered sample, reshaped in the shape of an irregular cube.

Input: 1 sample, Note
Setting: Fine
Output: A spherical mass of olivine with dark silicate minerals embedded onto its surface in a regular dodecahedral pattern. The sphere is capable of perception and movement, and mimics the behavior and sounds of a domestic cat (Felis catus).

Note: Say hi to Olive the peridot cat! -Cho

Note: Results are to be stored for personal use (with my permission) or in anomalous storage. Leave them in the testing area, and I'll assume that they have to be recycled. Looking at you, Cho. - Veritas

Note: 1. Does 914 like cats or something? 2. If the cat ball is still around should we introduce Jeff to Olive? -Intern Lunar

I think that’s because I put in a note saying ‘meow’. Also I would really like to see the two playing together. -Cho
Edit: I’m also requesting permission to keep Olive, by the way. -Cho

Test 914-0626
Name: Researcher Festiv
Date: 18/04/2019
Item: Nothing, one iron cube

Note: That's it, I'm going to turn the input and output into vacuums then activate 914. - Researcher Festiv

Input: Nothing
Setting: Very fine
Output: Nothing, 914 stopped for 10 minutes before 'finishing'.

Note: Well I gotta say, I don't know what I was expecting. Wait, just to make sure it still works right. - Researcher Festiv

Input: One iron cube
Setting: 1:1
Output: A memetic iron plate that only affects Researcher Festiv once, and has a frowning face engraved on it. Its memetic effect will make the viewer lose significant cognitive capability for the next 10 minutes and make the viewer dizzy.

Note: Ok, I deserved that. - Researcher Festiv

Test 914-0627
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 18/04/2019
Total Items: One copy of Lives of Girls and Women by Alice Munro, fifty A4 sized papers, one 500 mL bottle of ink
Note: Since 914 is capable of creativity, let's see if it can create a novel… - Dr. Cleveland

Input: All of the above
Setting: Fine
Output: One novel titled "Real World Adventures of Cassy Hicks", fifteen shredded A4 papers, one empty bottle.

Note: This sounds like something J. K. Rowling might write. Anyhow, it does qualify as creative, using SCP-085 as the protagonist. The novel's placed in the Break Room by the way. - Dr. Cleveland

Test 914-0628
Name: Dr. Beiderman, With N.C.E. present.
Date: 18/04/2019
Total Items: One Foundation Aerospace Rover. One 500 Megabyte memory card containing a copy of the N.C.E. AI program.
Note: He needs a body. -Dr. Beiderman.

Input: All of the above
Setting: Fine
Output: One Heavily modified F.A.R.. Appeared to have its gripping arms replaced with tasers, and its solar panels were replaced with a nuclear battery, theorized to increase energy conservation by 40%. Assaulted Dr. Beiderman before being captured by site staff. Dr. Beiderman was admitted to the medical wing for treatment of electrocution and heavy lacerations.

Note: Who approved this? Site security does not approve of using 914 to attempt to create life. You wanna get your friend a body Beiderman? Talk to Rosen you twat. - Security Chief Ozark

Test 914-0629
Name: Dr. Matism
Date: 18/04/2019
Total Items: One Aerobie Pro™ frisbee

Input: The frisbee
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The frisbee, but the edges are lined with an anomalous glowing material. Testing of this item shows that only Dr. Matism can catch the frisbee. Anyone else who attempts is shattered into a pile of glowing shards approximately 2 cm3 each.

Note: Ok, now 914 is blatantly ripping off the Tron light disk. This isn't the first time it's done something like this. Rest in pieces D-13992 - Dr. Matism

Note: If 914 ever makes another one of these, can we have competitive disk wars? I'll collaborate with Kain to make the armor - Dr. Matism

Note: No thanks, I choose life. - JR. Stan

Note: The next time Engelhart causes a containment breach, I know what weapon I'm using. Did I mention I was in my college's ultimate frisbee club? - Dr. Matism

- Hide 063X Test Logs
Test 914-0630
Name: Researcher Z. Larua
Date: 18/04/2019
Total Items: 5 copies of 'Ave Maria' sheet music

Input: 1 copy.
Setting: Rough.
Output: Finely shredded paper.

Input: 1 copy.
Setting: Coarse.
Output: Strips of paper with one unique measure from the song on each.

Input: 1 copy
Setting: 1:1
Output: Sheet music for 'Maria' from West Side Story.

Input: 1 copy
Setting: Fine
Output: A small wind-up music box shaped like SCP-066. Testing was performed in a soundproofed room with a D-Class wearing military grade hearing protection. Once wound, the song Ave Maria began to play at an extremely low volume. As the song continued to play, the decibel rating was observed to increase by 1dB every time a note played. D-Class was evacuated once this was observed. Decibel ratings were shown to reach their peak at 180dB before dropping back down to a varriable low decibel on the following note. Regardless of how much the box is wound, the entirety of the song is played and always seems to end with the final note ringing at 180dB.

Note: As badly as I wanted to burn that music box as soon as I saw it, I just had to know what exactly it did. -Larua

Input: 1 copy
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Music note shaped crystalline charms. When held in one's hand and rung, they induce a cognitohazardous effect that causes the holder to mentally hear the last song they heard. The holder becomes completely catatonic for the entire duration of the song and returns to normal once the song ends. Time seems to pass at ten times normal speed for the effected, causing a minute long song to end in mere six seconds real time. There have been no observed negative side effects of the charms.

Note: An interesting cognitohazard that is NOT harmful and/or brainwashing? This is quite the rare event! -Larua

Test 914-0631
Name: Jr. Researcher Ija Rasclon, D-126483
Date: 18/04/2019
Items: Six standard-issued SCP Foundation side arms.

Note: After the display Renwev put on, I'm intrigued by this machine. This test aims to determine how much the person placing the item in the input's opinion of the item can affect the output. Notably, I am a pacifist with an aversion to guns, while D-126483 is an anarchist who was convicted and arrested on multiple counts of second-degree murder with a firearm. Due to the obvious dangers of having a D-class handle weaponry, anomalous or otherwise, this test was conducted in the presence of security personnel, the handguns have had their ammunition removed, and a blast shield has been temporarily erected between the input and output sides of 914's room. These first three tests were conducted by D-126483. -Jr. Rasclon.

Note: If you damage the machine or the testing area, it's your ass. - Veritas

Input: One standard Foundation side arm.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One standard ██████ brand side arm.

Input: One side arm.
Setting: Fine
Output: A mechanical lock-picking device. While effective against most common key locks, it was ineffective against Foundation locks.

Input: One side arm.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One outwardly unchanged side arm. However, when security personnel picked up the armament, it began firing repeatedly. Security Officer Drey was unable to remove the anomalous firearm from his hand for approximately two minutes, while the weapon continued to fire. During this time he increasingly complained of hunger. When the firearm finished and fell out of his hand, Drey was sent to the infirmary for advanced malnutrition. The weapon was disposed of using standard hazardous object handling equipment.

Note: A lock-pick and a gun that works without ammunition. It seems 914 is working with D-126483's idea of guns as a tool for freedom here. The next three tests are conducted by me. -Jr. Rasclon.

Input: One side arm.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One standard Foundation side arm, of a variety which ceased production in 2003 due to redundancy.

Input: One side arm.
Setting: Fine
Output: One thermite landmine. When tested outside, the mine failed to detonate properly, due to an improper ratio of metal to metal oxide.

Input: One side arm.
Setting: Very Fine.
Output: One internally unchanged side arm. The side arm had been adorned with iron spikes reminiscent of Gothic architecture. The pattern of spikes had the memetic effect of causing anyone who approached it to feel a sense of fear and revulsion, directed towards the armament. Safely destroyed.

Note: These results would seem to indicate that 914 works with the operator's idea of the items entered, though I would like to test an alternative hypothesis at some point. I'll go ask for an extension to my stay at Site-19. -Jr. Rasclon.

Test 914-0632
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 18/04/2019
Total Items: Three 6kg metal spheres, 1 each of brass, copper, and aluminum.

Note: Sorry about earlier, 914. I guess making music isn't easy even for you, huh? -Prof. Wren

Input: The brass sphere.
Setting: Fine
Output: A brass polyhedron with 37 sides, each bearing one of 37 unique symbols. No anomalous properties found. Study of symbols pending.

Input: The copper sphere.
Setting: Fine
Output: A 237m spool of copper wire. No anomalous properties found.

Note: Well that was certainly anticlimactic compared to the first one. Still, should be handy for maintenance crews at least. -Prof. Wren

Input: The aluminum sphere.
Setting: Fine
Output: An aluminium polyhedron with 8 uneven sides, unmarked. An anomalous property was detected where anyone attempting to describe it would use the British term "aluminium" rather than the American term "aluminium" "aluminium" "aluminium" used to describe the input.

Note: This… I… no, y'know what? I don't even want to ask. - Prof. Wren

Note: It was later determined that the symbols on the brass polyhedron, when overlaid upon each other in a way matching their orientation on the object, produced a three-dimensional render of a smiley face.

Note: Don't know what you're complaining about, it's clearly the right way to say it. - Veritas

Test 914-0633
Name: Dr. Matism
Date: 18/04/2019
Items: One air conditioning condenser

Note: My A/C is broken

Input: One condenser
Setting: Fine Very Fine (Attending Jr. Guard Romanio was seen on security footage switching the setting to Very Fine)
Output: One condenser, when placed into an air conditioning unit, the air conditioning unit produces cold water instead of cold air by rapidly condensing water vapor present in the atmosphere.

Note: Well, there goes all my important papers. I'm coming for you with my frisbee Jr. Guard Romanio - Dr. Matism

Note: This is why Veritas replaced your frisbee with a well made replica. Good luck against those rubber bullets. - N.C.E.

Tell that to Romanio - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0634
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 19/04/2019
Total Items: 3 terrestrial globes displaying a political map of the Earth (2018)

Input: 1 globe
Setting: 1:1
Output: A globe displaying a political map of Mars.

Note: I know color choices are random on political maps, but a big green ball with "Mars" written on it just looks wrong. -Cho

Input: 1 globe
Setting: Fine
Output: A terrestrial globe that can be switched between a political map and a topological map via a switch on its base.

Input: 1 globe
Setting: Very fine
Output: A globe floating above a flat circular base. The globe displays a real-time geopolitical map of the Earth, and can be customized to view a via an anomalous touch-screen interface on one side of the base. It is also capable of displaying maps of a selection of other planets and moons in the Solar System. A second touch-screen interface on the base controls the orientation and rotation speed of the globe. The globe is fixed in position relative to the base, and has resisted attempts to move it. A circular button is present on the bottom of the base that, when pressed, destroys the globe.

Note: Oh. -Cho

Test 914-0635
Name: Researcher Lombardi
Date: 19/04/2019
Items: Three sets of wooden chopsticks

Note: We are continuing our tests with a 914 operator under the influence of mind-altering substances. Today we are testing with D-138840 under the effects of marijuana. - Lombardi

Input: One set of wooden chopsticks
Setting: 1:1
D-138840 THC: 50 ng/mL
Output: One double-length chopstick

Note: It's not just a 'stick'. It still has the telltale shape and snap-points common with disposable chopsticks. - Lombardi

Input: One set of wooden chopsticks
Setting: Fine
D-138840 THC: 50 ng/mL
Output: One set of wooden chopsticks engraved with a light swirl pattern. Objects demonstrate a cognitohazardous effect when viewed which delays their recognition as chopsticks for approximately 15 seconds. This effect is not encountered in photography or video.

Input: One set of wooden chopsticks
Setting: Very Fine
D-138840 THC: 50 ng/mL
Output: One finely crafted wooden spoon, carved into the shape of a laughing dragon. The following anomalous properties occur when spoon is held - Subject enters a state of seemingly endless hunger, which they will attempt to sate first with all nearby food and then other solids. Subject gains the ability to carve the spoon into solid matter near effortlessly in the pursuit of eating. Subject is able to consume all carved matter without suffering any ill effects. These properties cease as soon as the spoon is removed from their grip. Object incinerated without issue.

Note: The D-class testing the spoon suffered near-fatal injuries due to shards of glass and concrete in their intestinal tract. - Lombardi

Test 914-0636
Name: Jr. Researcher Ija Rasclon.
Date: 19/04/2019
Items: Three notes reading "Hello, my name is Ija Rasclon."

Note: I want to see how 914 reacts when addressed as/by a sapient being. -Jr. Rasclon.

Input: One note.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One note reading "Zdravstvuyte, menya zovut Iya Rashlon." (transliterated.) The original message translated into Russian.

Note: 1:1 seems to just change the object superficially, while preserving the same meaning, so this is unsurprising. -Jr. Rasclon.

Input: One note.
Setting: Fine
Output: A normal note reading "Hello, your name is Ija Rasclon." in an unusual font. The note has the memetic effect of causing anyone who views it for the first time to address themselves as Ija Rasclon for 30 minutes. Subjects remain unaware of this, and fail to recognize that they are sharing a name with Jr. Rasclon, with one subject stating "No, your name is Ija Rasclon, and my name is Ija Rasclon. They're not even similar."

Input: One note.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small, animate origami figure of a human. The figure introduced itself as Ija Rasclon, and when told of Jr. Rasclon's name, yelled "Impostor! You die in pain!" The figure then proceeded to attack Jr. Rasclon until it was neutralized by security personnel. Jr. Rasclon suffered no injury, due to the figure's material composition and size.

Note: I'm going to continue putting the note from the 'Fine' result in, for science. Also, why does the security team have a massive water cannon? -Jr. Rasclon.

Input: One memetic note, see above.
Setting: Fine
Output: A note reading "Hello, our name is Ija Rasclon." The memetic effect has been altered to have a duration of 10 minutes, is ineffectual on Jr. Rasclon, and causes those affected to replace any proper noun group in their speech with "Ija Rasclon". Anyone addressed as such by an affected individual also suffers the memetic effect. The effect failed to spread outside of the testing area, due to its temporary nature and inability to affect the same person twice.

Note: That was probably the most surreal thing I've ever experienced, and I've been assigned to 184. Anyway, 914 seems to have some measure of self-awareness and memory, as it remembered my name and said "our" when addressed with the same name. Putting the note through one more time on Coarse, because I don't want to "improve" the memetic effect, and because 'our' is reaching the limits of generalized pronouns. -Jr. Rasclon.

Input: Previous result.
Setting: Coarse
Output: A note reading "Hello, her name is Ija Rasclon." The note carries the memetic effect of causing anyone who reads it to become aware of JR. Rasclon's name and position, and to be able to identify her in a lineup. Effect was not neutralized by amnestics. Note was incinerated.

Note: I think that's enough memetics for a while. They do my head in. -Jr. Rasclon.

The following experiment was unauthorized. Relevant personnel, security or otherwise, have been reprimanded.

Test 914-0637
Name: Researcher Anne Douglas, D-1618
Date: 19/04/2019
Total Items: One Huawei P20 Pro smartphone, one bottle of oil, one laser pointer, one remote controlled mechanical arm.

Input: Huawei smartphone
Setting: Very fine

Note: Security footage showed that Researcher Douglas pushed D-1618 into 914, sending her into refinement. D-1618 was seen struggling for twenty seconds to prevent herself from falling into the input booth.

Output: D-1618 was visible for ten seconds, before vanishing into thin air. It is not known where D-1618 was sent to, nor the point of time to which she was sent to.

Input: Bottle of oil, laser pointer
Setting: Very fine.

Note: Security footage showed that Researcher Douglas jumped into the input booth as guards entered. They failed to prevent Researcher Douglas from refining herself via the mechanical arm.

Output: A mass of cooked ground meat of the same mass as Researcher Douglas; and a laser pointer which, if activated, burns everything in its line of fire.

Note: We will rule that Researcher Annette Francesca Douglas has committed suicide by 914 mincer. - Security Officer ██████

Addendum: A manifesto was found near the input booth. The document, authored by Researcher Anne Douglas herself, chastised the Foundation for its support of genocide campaigns, and its dehumanization of human SCPs. The manifesto ended with "The world shall be purified of evil, and they shall be free when the time comes." It should be noted that Researcher Douglas was of Lithuanian Jewish descent, and her paternal grandfather was a victim of the Holocaust.

Note: I'm out of patience. The next person that gives me any reason to suspect unauthorized biological testing will be terminated with extreme prejudice. Either by security personnel or my own discretion. - Veritas

Note: Lucius is a bit agitated right now, to put it mildly. I know, because he's not yelling at anyone. I recommend keeping the testing as safe as possible for a while, we don't want to see the stage after this, trust me. - Site Director Hackett

Test 914-0638
Name: Researcher Darby
Date: 19/04/2019
Total Items: 1365 bottles of Vodka, 230 bottles of Scotch, 47 Boxes of various teas;

Note: I'm back and ready for business, and hopefully 914 will make something I can give to Veritas as a peace offering. Maybe if I can not blow up the facility or anything else bad I wont get banished to Jupiter - Researcher Darby

Input: 1000 Bottles of Vodka
Setting: Fine
Output: 750 Gallon jugs of Premium Vodka

Input: 200 Bottles of Scotch
Setting: Fine
Output: 200 Bottles of Irish Whiskey

Input: 40 Boxes of various teas
Setting: Fine
Output: 40 Boxes of coffee

Note: Not an improvement 914, not an improvement in the slightest - Researcher Darby

Input: 365 bottles of Vodka, 30 bottles of scotch, 7 boxes of tea.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Unchanged upon drinking any of the output the drinker gains a reportedly hilarious accent and actions according to the type of drink. Drinking of Vodka causes a Russian or a similar accent and actions consistent to stereotype of drunk Russians. Drinking tea or scotch imparts the same effect with the difference of either a British or Scottish accent.

Note: I'm so glad I didn't drink any of the scotch. Also did I complete a test without anyone dying from anything? - Researcher Darby

Note: That Vodka was tested with a few D-Class personnel, who proceeded to attempt a revolution down in their cells, which killed two of them. I was on surveillance and saw when they broke out. They surprised two guards and managed to lock them in their cells. Then they took the D-Class that didn't drink the vodka and started accusing them of spying for the capitalists before shooting them. So no, you did not manage to run a test without casualties. - Security Chief Brandt

Note: On another note, however, Veritas seems to like that coffee you gave him. A lot. He has gone through 5 cups. With the help of said coffee, Darby managed to avoid whatever Veritas was going to do to him by employing the ''avoid eye contact and back away slowly'' technique. I recommend all personnel to maintain a distance of a least ten meters from the SCP-914 testing area for the next three days or so. - Security Chief Ozark

Test 914-0639
Name: Intern Lunar, Dr. Cleveland, Researcher Jane Cho, Researcher Darby, JR. Rasclon, MT Johnson, Junior Researcher Stan
Date: 23/04/2019
Total Items: 35 ███████ brand chocolate bunnies, 7 pocket watches.

Note: Since Veritas has stopped twitching whenever any of us go near the testing area, we’ve starting testing back up. To start, we wanted to see scientifically whether or not 914 is capable of holding grudges, and has opinions of specific people. To do this, every test will use the same input and setting. 5 chocolate rabbits and a hand watch is the input, partially just as arbitrary complex objects for 914 to project meaning onto, and partly in keeping with the holiday spirit. Fine is the setting, chosen because it has more variance than the other options, but is less likely to kill people than Very Fine. We also have a lot of security and medical personnel on standby, due to 914’s repeated attempts on… certain researchers’ lives.

Note: The following test was performed by Intern Lunar.

Input: 5 Chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 chocolate dog with a watch set in to it, the wrappers read “what goes tick tock woof.”

Note: It’s a “watchdog” - Intern Lunar

Note: The following test was performed by MT Johnson.

Input: 5 Chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch.
Setting: Fine
Output: One chocolate and plastic bunny sculpture that can be mounted on a wall. It contains clockwork components and makes bunny noises at passersby. It can also wiggle its nose and move its ears. It possesses the anomalous property that people who look at it feel amused instead of what they were originally feeling. The effect fades almost immediately after viewing of the object ceases and no after effects whatsoever have been noted. The effect is strongest on MT Johnson and does not affect Researcher Darby at all. Instead, the sculpture makes aggressive bunny noises towards him.

Note: It’s a chocolate clockwork wall bunny that makes you feel happy. It’s good for at least briefly cheering someone up when they feel down. It’s also slightly anomalous in that it can react to outside stimulus, but that’s about it. 914 still seems to like me. - MT Johnson

Note: The following test was performed by JR. Rasclon.

Input: 5 chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch.
Setting: Fine
Output: An anomalous, semi-solid lump of chocolate and metal which is capable of slow movement. When moving, it emits faint ticking sounds reminiscent of clockwork. This mass can be controlled by the last person to have interacted with it, moving exactly opposite to how the controller intended. This was seen to be consistent among all personnel who operated it.

Note: When Researcher Darby touched it, it immediately shaped into a form with many sharp edges and points, and began moving towards him in a hostile manner. It was easily stopped by a security guard, due to its slow speed. Darby later said the only thing he had tried to make it do was to not kill him.

Note: This thing is really unintuitive. It’s like playing a video game with reversed controls, only with a 3-dimensional form. Still, it’s possible to control once you get the hang of it. I’d like to apply to keep and study it, after putting it through every level of hazard testing I can find, of course. -Rasclon.

Note: The following test was performed by Dr. Cleveland.

Note: Let's see what I would get - Dr. Cleveland

Input: 5 Chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 pocket watch made of chocolate, and one intricate robot bunny. Testing on the former showed that while edible, the chocolate will not melt under a heat of ████K, has a Vickers hardness of 14100, and is compatible with standard pocket watch components. The latter has no anomalous properties.

Note: That means it is brittle. Like diamond. I'll keep the bunny. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: The following test was performed by Researcher Jane Cho.

Input: 5 Chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch.
Setting: Fine
Output: 8 animate chocolate bunnies, smaller and rounder in appearance, tied to a small 5-wheeled clockwork machine via metal chains. The machine is composed of a large center wheel connected via axles to a structure with 4 legs, each with a small wheel at the bottom. While the center wheel rotates, it plays a repeating tune via a mechanism similar to a music box. The chocolate bunnies are compelled to pull the machine indefinitely and will only stop when tired. Occasionally, some of the bunnies may fall asleep while the others are still pulling the machine.

Note: The following test was performed by Researcher Darby.

Note: I am the last one to do this test. Hopefully all goes well - Researcher Darby

Note: Don’t worry, we've got 7 security guards & 3 medical doctors on standby if things do go wrong. - Dr. Clockworks

Note: Famous last words -Intern Lunar

Input: 5 chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch.
Setting: Fine Very Fine (The identity of the person who let Jr. Guard Romanio into 914’s testing area again is currently unknown)
Output: One large chocolate rabbit whose eyes have been replaced by a singular large metallic gem-like protrusion with clockwork decorations. Upon sighting Researcher Darby it charged forwards and shot beams of energy from its gem at security personnel. After dealing with the local security personnel, it proceeded to attack Researcher Darby with its claws leaving major wounds. Reserve personnel arrived and began firing at the Rabbit causing it to explode into liquid chocolate, leaving a large puddle of red-coloured chocolate and the gem-like object.

Note: The energy rays produced by the gemstone upon contact with living organisms accelerates entropy to a point that immediately after being hit, the affected region becomes unresponsive and blackens as if from a major burn. After several minutes, if the affected region is not treated by amputation, the effect spreads to the whole body and death is observed after several hours. The gemstone has been sent to secure storage for containment and possible future study. - Medical Director Candon

Note: Okay, so that's not how this works. Who wrote ''energy ray''? Gemstones are not power sources either. That's a laser, it's concentrated light. From what the lab boys tell me, the rabbit used some sort of chemical reaction from the chocolate and used the materials from the watch to create an optical amplifier. I personally think that they're making something up because they can't figure out how it works exactly, but with 914's track record, I don't blame them. - Veritas

Note: I knew this would happen. Veritas, can you send Romanio to Antarctica? - Dr. Matism

Note: And you didn't warn me or your colleague? I'm not in the mood for smartasses, get out of my testing area or you'll be the one going. And it's Dr. Veritas for you. - Veritas

Test 914-0640
Name: Dr. Terren
Date: 23/04/2019
Total items: Various researchers former lab coats.

Note: Just to specify, I got them by asking. -Terren.

Input: Dr. Lombardi’s former lab coat
Setting: Fine
Output: Clothes that resemble the video game character Falco Lombardi’s clothes. They are made from the exact same material from the lab coat and have the same mass.

Note: These look like they would have fit me perfectly 15 years ago. -Lombardi

Input: Dr. Thompson’s former lab coat
Setting: 1:1
Output: One sweatshirt and T-shirt made from the former lab coat.

Input: Dr. Nukea’s former lab coat
Setting: Fine
Output: A shirt with the entire script of ''17 again'' woven into the fabric by thread.

Note: I’ll take that, thank you very much -Nukea.

Test 914-0641
Name: Dr. Crown
Date: 23/04/2019
Total Items: One Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080-Ti graphics card

Input: One Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080-Ti graphics card
Setting: Fine
Output: One Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080-Ti graphics card, whose decorative angles constantly shift in position while being used in a powered PC. Other than that, it operates as expected from the device.

Note: Further testing revealed that the "shifting" of the angles consumes processing power. It's even listed under processes in the task manager. You can end the task, but you can only restart it by restarting the computer. -Dr. Crown

Test 914-0642
Name: Guest Researcher Pukotta; D-54121
Date: 23/04/2019
Total Items: Twenty-one loaded dice

Input: Six loaded dice
Setting: Fine
Output: A miniature colourless magic cube. The sides are distinguished by varying weights instead of the usual coloured stickers. 113 pips are chaotically distributed over all sides of the output and do not correspond to the weight of the cubies.

Input: Five loaded dice
Setting: Fine
Output: Fifty small quadratic plates made out of the same synthetic material as the input. Each of them features an engraved copy of the faces of the playing card deck Industrie und Glück, traditionally used in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to play Tarock. The four kings of the original deck do not appear in the output.

Input: Four loaded dice
Setting: Fine
Output: A loaded gömböc, resembling model 400. Eighty-four pips are distributed unequally on the two sides which are facing upwards on the original gömböc 400. Due to the output's uneven distribution of mass, it is not considered a proper gömböc. Additionally, the test result stands on one of the dotted faces in its resting state.

Input: Three loaded dice
Setting: Fine
Output: A polyhedron with eighteen faces of different area and shape. The output can not be used as a proper 18-sided die, due to its irregular form. 153 pips are distributed evenly on the sides of the test result and correspond inversely proportional to the area of the face they are printed onto.

Input: Two loaded dice
Setting: Fine
Output: One white solid and one black hollow dice. The total mass of the output is equal to the total mass of the input. Both dice contain a cognitohazard on one face. Subjects, who directly touch the cognitohazardous face and lift the die, conjecture the die to be loaded. This effect is reversible by touching the die anywhere else and lifting it. Neither die is loaded or dotted.

Input: One loaded die
Setting: Fine
Output: A ball with a single dot printed onto it.

Note: I have to admit, I am disappointed in 914's last output. The five outputs before this were interesting and took different takes on the concept of the input, but this "one-sided die"… 914 ran dry of ideas. - Guest Researcher Pukotta

Test 914-0643
Name: Dr. Matism
Date: 23/04/2019
Item: Dr. Matism's sword

Note: It's for science, I swear.

Input: The sword
Setting: Fine
Output: One small scythe comprised entirely of metal, perfectly sharpened and buffed.

Note: What am I supposed to do with this? Harvest the anomalies that 914 makes? That would only work if I filled the thing with wheat. It's also useless because of how terribly balanced it is. - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0644
Name: Dr. Scotty
Date: 23/04/2019
Total Items: 1 3/8" drive 10mm socket, 1 1/2" drive 10mm deep socket, 1 10mm open ended wrench, and 1 1/2" impact driver (pneumatic)
Maintenance is requesting we test if 914 can be used to augment common tools they frequently are required to replace due to breakage or being worn down. -Dr. Scotty

Input: 1 3/8" drive 10mm socket
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 3/8" drive 197/500" socket

Note: Well, still the same size… -Dr. Scotty

Input: 1 1/2" drive 10mm deep socket
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 10mm drive 1/2" deep socket

Input: 1 10mm open ended wrench
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 10 1mm open ended wrenches

Note: I heard this thing had a sense of sarcasm, but this seems backwards… -Dr. Scotty

Input: 10 1mm open ended wrenches
Setting: Coarse
Output: 1 10mm block of steel, weight analysis shows it equals the equivalent of the 10 1mm open ended wrenches used for input

Input: 1 1/2" impact driver (pneumatic)
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 1/2" impact driver (electric)

Input: 1 1/2" impact driver (electric)
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 1/2" impact driver (electric and pneumatic settings)

Note: Nifty… I could see this being rather useful in various settings. -Dr.Scotty

Input: 1 1/2" impact driver (electric and pneumatic)
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 1/2" impact driver (nuclear)

Note: I wonder what happens if we push it further. -Dr.Scotty

Input: 1 1/2" impact driver (nuclear)
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 3/4" impact driver (pneumatic)

Note: I give up. -Dr.Scotty

Test 914-0645
Name: Dr. Matism
Date: 23/04/2019
Items: One rebreather

Note: I'm going diving.

Input: The rebreather
Setting: Fine
Output: A rebreather, that when used underwater, performs electrolysis on the water, converting it into hydrogen.

Note: This is the second time the thing has made me something that creates unbreathable gasses, I'm almost past the breaking point. - Dr. Matism

Note: Can I have that? -Intern Lunar

Note: What would be the point of having it? It would literally kill you if you tried to use it - Dr. Matism

Note: I was going to make a generator -Intern Lunar

Test 914-0646
Name: Researcher Edwards
Date: 23/04/2019
Total Items: 5 [REDACTED] brand inhalers containing salbutamol sulfate

Input: One of the aforementioned inhalers
Setting: Rough
Output: One puddle of a mixture later determined to be melted white, light blue and dark blue plastic, and a melted unknown metal.

Note: During this test a small bang was heard from within 914 in addition to the expected clockwork sounds. This is believed to be the opening of the metal canister and release of both the propellant and salbutamol -Researcher Edwards

Input: One of the aforementioned inhalers
Setting: Coarse
Output: One cube of light blue plastic, one cube of dark blue plastic and one cube of white plastic weighing approx. 10g, 3g and 0.5g respectively. One cube of unknown metal weighing approx. 20-25g. One cube of solid salbutamol sulfate and one cube of an unknown Hydrofluorochlorine, both of which immediately dissipated into 914’s output chamber.

Input: One of the aforementioned inhalers
Setting: 1:1
Output: One [REDACTED] brand preventative inhaler containing the asthma treating steroid Beclometasone

Input: One of the aforementioned inhalers
Setting: Fine
Output: One [REDACTED] brand combination inhaler containing fostair, a relieving and preventative drug.

Note: Upon Class-D testing with D-6289, a known sufferer of severe asthma, it appeared to have no adverse effects and functioned as normal. There had been no asthma attacks suffered by D-6289 for a week, actually. He isn't cured though, an attack occurred two days after said week, and the improved result only seemed to work with the fostair already in the inhaler on output, not when we refill it ourselves. - Researcher Edwards

Input: One of the aforementioned inhalers
Setting: Very fine
Output: One large clockwork bee approx. 13cm long, formed of intricate gears made of the unknown metal and all three coloured plastics. The wings appear to be made of crystalline salbutamol sulfate which is being held at a constant 25°C no matter the environment it is contained within. No stinger appears present.

Note: This is honestly both the scariest and cutest bee I’ve ever seen. I would like permission to keep the bee in my office - Researcher Edwards

Note: I would bee careful -Intern Lunar

Note: Keep that away from Researcher Stan - Researcher Darby

Note: Keep it, but I'm not responsible if that thing sucks your brain out in a month. - Veritas

Test 914-0647
Name: Researcher Collins
Date: 23/04/2019
Total Items: One piano

Input: One piano
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An anomalous piano. Upon playing the piano, every human within a 10 meter radius will have an overwhelming desire to listen to said piano.

Note: I mean, I’m not complaining. I'm not going to play this around here though. - Researcher Collins

Note: So, when the report said ''listening to said piano'', I assumed that it meant ''someone playing on it''. What Collins didn't mention (see me in my office for that, by the way) is that the cognitohazard triggers regardless of it being played on or not; my cleanup crew sat in a circle around the damn thing for two hours before I found them there, listening to absolutely nothing in total fascination. Piano has been incinerated. - Veritas

Test 914-0648
Name: Junior Technical Writer Natascha Wright
Date: 23/04/2019
Total Items: One halfway-corrected copy of the 914 test logs, two copies of a 6-page document detailing various grammatical rules, two dictionaries, one pair of reading glasses.

Note: I've just been assigned to ensure that these documents conform to Foundation writing standards and guidelines. I've read enough of the logs to know that this is probably a bad idea, but it's gotta be worth a shot, right?

Input: The copy of the 914 test logs, one grammar document, one dictionary.
Setting: Fine
Output: A stack of paper the combined size of the three inputs. The first page is stylized to look like the cover of a standard composition notebook, with the title "Do your own work: A comprehensive list of people who answer to you." written in JTW Wright's handwriting in the designated space. All other pages are blank.

Note: Laughed my ass off. Touche, 914. Okay, one more try. Perhaps I can get something that will at least highlight needed fixes for me? -JTW Wright

Input: One pair of reading glasses, one grammar document, one dictionary.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Unchanged. A pair of reading glasses, as well as the two input documents. When the reading glasses are worn, a cognitohazardous effect causes the wearer to become incapable of recognizing any errors in written word. This effect persists for an unknown length of time five hours after taking off the glasses.

ntoe: screw you 914, im gonna lose a while days work thnks to you. -JTW Wright

Test 914-0649
Name: Researcher Jane Cho

Total Items: One globe displaying a political map of Mars

Note: It's the green sphere labeled "Mars"' from the test I did last week. - Jane Cho

Input: Said globe
Setting: 1:1
Output: Identical globe, but colored purple

Note: Really? - Jane Cho

Input: Above output
Setting: 1:1
Output: Globe displaying a political map of the Moon, purple

Note: Ok. - Jane Cho

Test 914-0650
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 24/04/2019
Total Items: One viola

Input: Viola
Setting: Fine
Output: One violin, and a wooden tube shaped like a funnel. The words "violin shrinker" is engraved onto the tube. When the violin is entered through the large end of the tube, a spatial anomaly is formed and the violin decreases in size enough to pass through the small end, where it grows back to its original size upon exiting. This only occurs when the above violin is entered, and does not work with other violins.

Note: As an experiment to test if the violin can fit into spaces smaller than its original size, I used the violin shrinker to inject said violin into Jeff the mug cat. Apparently the spatial anomaly only affects the violin itself, so it broke upon growing back. Jeff is undamaged. - Jane Cho

Note: If you keep putting random stuff in Jeff, there is going to be problems. Please stop. -Intern Lunar

Test 914-0651
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 24/04/2019
Total Items: 1 photograph of Professor K. P. Crow printed on standard A4 printing paper, A lump of purple polymer clay (50g)

Note: We know 914 can draw. I'm going to see if 914 can sculpt clay. - Jane Cho

Input: Photograph, lump of clay
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 origami dog and 1 origami crow. The polymer clay is unaltered. The origami dog is capable of mimicking human behavior, however is not presumed to be sapient. The origami crow is strongly attracted to the color purple and will attempt to approach anything purple whenever possible. Notably, due to its composition, the origami crow is unable to fly.

Note: I'm requesting to keep the origami animals in my office. - Jane Cho

Note: See above, although I don't see that thing doing more damage than a mean paper cut. - Veritas

Note: The stupid crow followed me around all day yesterday because I wore a purple shirt. Apparently it followed me all the way to my house too. How it got past site security at the entrance, I don’t know. -Dr. N████ Trandfir

Test 914-0652
Name: Researcher Lombardi and Dr. Sheila Roland
Date: 24/04/2019
Total Items: One copy of fitness self-help book, "Meeting your better you" by Michelle Mullands, one bottle of oral anabolic steroids, one box of nicotine patches, two vials of class-A amnestics, one Foundation training manual on memetic resistance, one bottle of Ritalin, one MTF training manual.

Note: The following tests were sponsored by Vibrance Pharmaceuticals, a Foundation shell company. They're looking to jump-start their R&D projects. Specifically, something akin to a solider in a bottle. A product that could be given to MTFs or even groups of civilians in case of a major containment breach or crisis that would increase ability to succeed under pressure. To be viable, this needs to be non-anomalous and reproducible.

Note: Look, we all know that using 914 for a targeted outcome is like playing darts with a water balloon, but they're going to double our annual budget this year just for trying. -Lombardi

Note: ''to be non-anomalous and reproducible?'' And you're going to use the machine for it? Good luck with that. - Veritas

Input: One copy of "Meeting your better you".
Setting: 1:1
Output: One copy of "Market fundamentals - Success in the new economy" by Harrison Lewis. No record of such a title exists, but is otherwise non-anomalous. Details sound investment and savings strategies.

Note: I had intended to use a second copy of "Meeting your better you" with the following experiment rather than the output of the previous test. -Lombardi

Input: One copy of "Market fundamentals - Success in the new economy", one bottle of oral anabolic steroids.
Setting: Fine
Output: One bottle of pills and one book. Pill bottle is labeled as a financial supplement called 'Savitrol'. Testing with D-class on historical stock data has shown a 15% increase in ROI. Pills appear to be non-anomalous, presumably made of a mixture of steroids along with other compounds found in book printing and plastics manufacture. Currently undergoing reverse-engineering and synthesis analysis.

Book is a copy of "How to be a raging █████" by Charles Stonk. No record of such a title or author exists, but is otherwise non-anomalous. Book details poor life strategies such as taking great personal offense to small slights, reacting to questions with violence, and blaming ones problems on others. Notably, the book does not mention the use of anabolic steroids.

Note: "Save it all with Savitrol", these will practically sell themselves. -Dr. Roland

Note: You're not doing anything with those until they're through a thorough screening from the cognitohazard department, the Internal Security Department, the Logistics, Manufacturing, Medical, Scientific Department, the Ethics Committee. And Hackett. - Veritas

Input: One box of nicotine patches, two vials of class-A amnestics, one Foundation training manual on memetic resistance.
Setting: Fine
Output: One unlabeled box of medicinal patches, one glass case containing a Foundation training manual. Manual contains instructions on how to smoke, along with a memetic compulsion to do so. There are no records of the Foundation ever producing a smoking manual.

The medicinal patches successfully inhibit memetic afflictions, including the smoking compulsion, but the effect only lasts four hours.

Note: I don't think we'll try to reproduce these; temporarily suppressing memetics is just as likely to cause them to evade detection and containment as it is help in an emergency. Still, we'll take a few of the patches and see if there is any insight in the active ingredient. - Dr.Roland

Input: One bottle of Ritalin, one MTF training manual
Setting: Fine
Output: A thick paper box containing an object resembling a candy bracelet.

Note: We don't know what this will do, but it's too dangerous to potentially give a D-Class MTF training. We'll be testing with a willing, low-ranking Foundation volunteer instead. -Lombardi

Note: As instructed, volunteer consumed one piece off of the bracelet. Subject immediately showed skills and knowledge appropriate for an MTF operative including weapons training and crisis management. Volunteer showed no recognition of their name or identity, claiming to be MTF recruit "Mike T. Finnegan". Consumption of a second pill showed no further increase in skill, but subject now claimed to be MTF operative "Michelle T. Fallon". Volunteer currently undergoing amnestic treatment. Remainder of bracelet has been moved to anomalous item storage.

Test 914-0653
Name: Intern Lunar
Date: 24/04/2019
Total Items: 25 kazoos, Note: whoever keeps putting random crap in Jeff (the mug cat), stop. Jeff prefers liquids, not solids. -Intern Lunar a mug, and a sharpie.

Input: All 25 kazoos
Setting: Fine
Output: A (small) tree made of kazoos

Note: It actually grows somehow. The only problem is it sometimes plays music, badly. -Intern Lunar
Note: Turns out that it wants water when it plays music badly. When I gave it some water in a mug with dirt in it, the kazoo tree played jingle bells -Intern Lunar

Input: The mug and the sharpie
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 off brand sharpie, slightly used, and a flower pot with a face. The face will sometimes be replaced by words such as "water me" and "the cat is staring at me again". The face seems to show emotion.

Note: I have put the kazoo tree in the flower pot -Intern Lunar

Note: If allowed I will be keeping these. -Intern Lunar

Note: Apparently it doesn’t respond to Olive. Maybe that’s because Olive doesn’t have eyes. - Jane Cho

Note: It looked at me and its face turned into the phrase, “And the apocalypse shall walk among us” - Researcher Darby

Note: Sounds about right. How are you still alive after the death bunny? - Intern Lunar

Note: You came to see me in the Infirmary, and brought the plant - Researcher Darby

Note: Still, how are you alive. If I didn’t know better, I would think you and death are close friends -Intern Lunar

Note: O5-13 would like to talk to Darby as soon as he is back on his feet. -Dr. Beiderman

Test 914-0654
Name: Dr. Nukea
Date: 24/04/2019
Total items: A copy of 17 again

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Very fine
Output: A copy of 17 again that is covered in blue paint and the words DO NOT TOUCH are written on it in black. When touched by D-72882 he shrunk and had the mentality of a 17 year old. However, when Nukea touched it, no anomalous effects were present.

Note: Looked at the files, D-72882’s previous first name was Mike. -Nukea

Note: Objects that might grant immortality could warrant further investigation. Will the effect happen if someone legally changes their name to Mike, or do they need to have been named Mike while age 17? Does D-72882 have memories of being older or have we swapped him for his younger self? In the latter scenario, there may be ethical implications of keeping someone who has not yet technically committed any crimes. -Lombardi

Test 914-0655
Name: Dr. Peters
Date: 24/04/2019
Items: 5 unused Tungsten alloy darts, removed from the packaging with gloves to prevent contamination.

Note: Pending approval of testing using tissue samples, I am running a few tests to familiarize myself with SCP-914 starting with a relatively simple object.

Input: 1 tungsten alloy dart as above
Setting: Rough
Output: 1 irregular block of pure tungsten, fragments of copper, shreds of nylon.

Note: as expected based on results seen by other researchers. -Dr. Peters

Input: 1 tungsten alloy dart as above
Setting: Coarse
Output: 1 squared block of tungsten, 1 sphere of copper, 4 squares of nylon

Note: Again, as expected, disassembled as on the rough setting but arranged more orderly. -Dr. Peters

Input: One tungsten alloy dart as above
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 shuffleboard puck the same mass as the dart, the bottom surface is lined with nylon

Note: Testing on a desk suggests performance on par or slightly above commercially available pucks. Permission to keep for personal use? -Dr. Peters

Input: One tungsten alloy dart as above
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 tungsten alloy dart, analysis shows the point is sharp to 1 atom. When given to a D-class for testing, they missed the dart board given to aim at. However, the dart stuck fast into the steel wall where it hit. No attempt at removal has been successful

Note: Make sure the D-class chosen can aim next time. -Dr. Peters

Input: One tungsten alloy dart as above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A scale model of The Thinker by Auguste Rodin, analysis shows the bottom is lined with a thin layer of nylon. Anomalous effect of causing anyone who holds it to cease whatever they were doing and think of a pun which they then share with as many individuals as possible until contact is severed.

Note: As amusing as it was to see a D-class sprinting around shouting particularly awful puns, item has been moved to secure storage for containment and future study. -Dr. Peters

Test 914-0656
Name: Dr. Rumbold
Date: 24/04/2019
Items: 4 boxes of Totino’s Pizza Rolls, 4 Great Value brand paper plates.

Input: 1 box of Totino’s Pizza Rolls and 1 Great Value paper plate.
Setting: Rough
Output: A thick paste that consists of paper, cardboard, ink, and the ingredients in the pizza rolls.

Input: Same as above.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One box of Ore Ida Bagel Bites and a Dixie Everyday Paper Plate.

Input: Same as above.
Setting: Fine
Output: An empty box of Totino’s pizza rolls and the contents of the box on the plate, heated to 160º Fahrenheit.

Note: It took approximately 2 minutes and 30 seconds for the output to arrive, most likely because of the microwave directions’ estimated cooking time.

Input: Same as above.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An empty box of Totino’s pizza rolls and the contents of the box on the plate. The pizza rolls will not cool down from 160º Fahrenheit. No testing with consuming the rolls will be conducted.

Note: Can I take a few of these to use as hand warmers? -Dr. Rumbold

Test 914-0657
Name: Dr. Beiderman
Date: 24/04/2019
Items: One spool of "Wite-Out" brand white-out, D-80396

Input: Spool of "Wite-Out"
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One spool of "SUPAH-WITE-OUT". When D-80396 attempted to collect it, both they and the spool disappeared.

Note: Something must be wrong. I don't remember performing this experiment or writing this documentation, and that serial number does not show as ever being registered to a D-Class.- Dr. Beiderman

Test 914-0658
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 24/04/2019
Items: A set of 24 brass tabernacle bells, each tuned to a different note across 2 octaves, a trumpet.

Note: What can I say, ever since 914 made that tree-xylophone, I've become a bit of an instrument junkie. -Prof. Wren

Input: All 24 bells.
Setting: Fine
Output: An electric guitar. The neck is made of the wood from the bell handles, while the body, amp jack, and strings are made of brass. Notes played on the guitar sound as though they are being played on the bells. While no electronic components are present, the jack is fully functional.

Note: Testing was paused to determine whether an amp would work with the guitar. Upon verification, Prof. Wren proceeded to play approximately 20 seconds of Eric Clapton's "Layla" before ceasing, citing the sound as being "absolutely god-awful."

Note: Guess they can't all be winners. Neat concept, but rock music is definitely not the genre for this thing. -Prof. Wren

Input: The trumpet.
Setting: Fine
Output: A similar trumpet. Testing revealed the notes it plays to be exponentially louder; a note normally played at 12 decibels comes out at 144 decibels, for example.

Note: Prof. Wren was taken to the infirmary to be treated for hearing damage. Repairs for windows and audio recording equipment have been scheduled.

Note: You take care of her, that's the one employee that's actually good at her job, despite giving me tinnitus. - Veritas

Test 914-0659
Name: Junior Researcher Stan
Date: 24/04/2019
Total Items: Several paper cubes and shapes folded and painted to look like blocks and items from the game “Minecraft.” Paper blocks and items include: One crafting table, two sticks, and three diamonds

Note: Researcher Edwards' bee attacked me in my sleep last night. Ideally, for the test, 914 will “craft” the items into a diamond pickaxe. - Stan

Input: Above items
Setting: Fine
Output: Paper had been folded and fused together to create a pickaxe form the game, but the handle was diamond and the head was wood. Excess paper and paint, including the crafting table, had been compacted into the handle to increase the durability. When held by the handle and used on a 1kg rock sample, the pickaxe was not effective, however, when held by the head the pickaxe was easily able to break the rock. The pickaxe was more effective against stronger materials than weaker ones, meaning that something like cloth or a pillow was largely unaffected, while steel was broken with relative ease. After five tests on various materials, the item released a loud “breaking” noise and disintegrated.

Note: I’m almost glad it’s gone. That thing was an abomination. - Stan

Test 914-0660
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 24/04/2019
Total Items: A set of plastic eating utensils (dish, fork, spoon, knife), 5 grams of gold

Input: Set of utensils, Gold
Setting: Fine
Output: A set of gold-coated plastic eating utensils. When any substance is placed on the dish, it will be replaced an expensive high-quality dish resembling the original substance in some way. Upon transformation, the eating utensils will animate and vocalize criticisms regarding the original 'food', and occasionally will go as far as to throwing the food onto the floor when the quality is low enough.

Note: During test 49, a piece of human feces was placed on the dish, making the utensils scream and violently assault the testing researcher. The utensils then proceeded to attempt an escape from the facility. Site security was dispatched to the location, and the fork and knife were recovered successfully. The whereabouts of the spoon and the dish are currently unknown. Personnel coming across a gold plated spoon or dish on the floor is to report to site security immediately. - Security Chief Ozark

Note: They put what on this thing? - Jane Cho

Note: Found the rest. Luckily, Cho decided to use pure gold, which is very soft. The utensils are neutralised. Speaking of pure gold, Cho, you overdrew your research budget by 700% for this week, hope the insight was worth it. - Veritas

Note: We have research budgets? - Intern Lunar

Note: What do you think I do here all day besides making sure you all don't kill yourself in various spectacular ways? As Head of Experimental Security and Director of Research, I get a budget from Hackett like every other department. Come to think of it, I should probably explain what happened before Norton from Accounting starts complaining to him. - Veritas

Note: Do I not have one seeing as I'm an intern then? - Intern Lunar

Note: Testing with mugs and the like isn't a particularly large dent to the budget, Lunar. - Veritas

Input: 1 Bottle of Class-B amnestics
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 Bottle of Class-Y mnestics

Input: 1 Bottle of Class-B amnestics
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 Bottle of Class-A amnestics

Input: 1 Bottle of Class-B amnestics
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 Bottle of Class "Darby" amnestics. One dose allows you to forget the existence of Researcher Darby for approximately 1 hour. Contains 200 doses, according to the label. Bottle was given to Veritas for personal use.

Note: And he better thank me for it. Everyone on site would love to own that bottle, myself included. -Dr. Beiderman

Note: I don't remember why, but I wrote a note to myself to give you a raise next time we evaluate your contract. Must be a good reason. - Veritas

Test 914-0665
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 25/04/2019
Total Items: 3 Casio synthesizers, 3 Sony Walkman cassette players, 3 blank tape cassettes.

Note: Let's see how 80's 914 can be. -Prof. Wren

Input: A synthesizer, player, and cassette.
Setting: Fine
Output: A synthesizer with a tape deck attached to it, capable of recording music played on it to a cassette. Initial plays of the cassette found it to still be blank.

Note: Neat! -Prof. Wren

Input: A synthesizer, player, and cassette.
Setting: Fine
Output: A somewhat larger tape player with synthesizer keys and setting controls on each side. Tape deck accessible by pulling the device apart at the sides; doing this repeatedly allows the device to be played like an instrument.

Note: Did…did 914 just turn these things into an accordion? -Prof. Wren

Input: A synthesizer, player, and cassette.
Setting: Very Fine

Note: Oh crap, I must have bumped the dial. Everybody out! -Prof. Wren

Output: A 19-inch tall replica of Rick Astley made of synthesizer and cassette parts. It spent the next 2 hours continuously playing, and dancing to, the singer's hit single "Never Gonna Give You Up." An anomalous property of the device caused those who heard it to dance along with it uncontrollably. Device ceased function after security personnel equipped with hearing protection destroyed it.

Note: Okay…in fairness, that could have gone a lot worse, but that was still unpleasant. Also, I know I can't actually prove it, but I just know this is somehow Calloway's fault. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0666
Name: Dr Clocks
Date: 25/04/2019
Total Items: Three stacks of playing cards

Note: Seen as though the other items I've placed into 914 have resulted in complete data leaks. I've decided to instead use more 'passive' items. Though I don't want to curse my chances. -Dr Clocks

Input: One stack of playing cards.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A standard stack of playing cards. However, all the colours have been swapped around. Diamonds and hearts are now coloured black and vice versa.

Note: While not exactly anomalous in nature. It is sure to at least cause minor confusion in players. -Dr Clocks

Input: One stack of playing cards.
Setting: Fine
Output: An altered stack of playing cards. Aces have been replaced with 1's. The King has been replaced with an Emperor. The Queen has been replaced with what appears to be a president. And the Jack has been replaced with a chancellor.

Note: The exact nature on how we found these names was mainly due to the fact that we kept the rule card inside the pack. -Dr Clocks

Input: One stack of playing cards.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One heavily altered stack of playing cards. The majority of cards in the stack have now been replaced with Joker cards, though the King, Queen and Jack are theorized to have been altered differently. Aside from all the other Joker cards, there are three other cards. One card appears to be detailed with a small, 'tame' anomalous figure. Another has a great, monstrous creature printed on it. The last one, details an aggrivated, monstrous tearing at the paper it is printed on. Each image also has each character holding what appears to be a scythe. The letters written on these cards were 'S', 'G' and 'A'.

Note: It went slightly better then expected. But then again, it is just a pack of playing cards. And as an additional note, I've also had the last stack of cards incinerated. They were pretty pointless anyway. -Dr Clocks

Test 914-0667
Name: Dr. Beiderman
Date: 25/04/2019
Items: 3 bottles of Class-A amnestics

Note: Given the rousing success of the tests with the Class-B amnestics, I have decided to move onto something stronger. - Dr. Beiderman

Input: 1 Bottle of Class-A amnestics
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 Bottle of Class-Z mnestics

Input: 1 Bottle of Class-A amnestics

Output: 324 Origami Formic Drone's, 1 Origami Formic Queen

Note: Formic is the proper name of the Buggers of the book - Researcher Fa Ke

Input: The Cobra Event
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Paper Dust Origami versions of the Cobra Virus in "The Cobra Event". Though proven simply paper the containment chamber was decontaminated with a Gasoline-Bleach mixture that was set on fire to eliminate any threat of viral infection.

Note: Requesting hazmat suits to be added to the testing equipment bay. - Researcher Fa Ke

Input: Starship Troopers
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One large Origami Soldier identifying himself as "Juan "Johnny" Rico". Sadly destroyed when given a cigarette and a lighter upon asking for one. His ashes have been given to Researcher Fa Ke for burial.

Note: He was really something wasn't he, 914 can do some cool stuff - Researcher Fa Ke

Note: I'm unclear on why you thought giving that thing a lighter wasn't a poor idea. - Veritas

Total Items: 3 bottles of Class-Y mnestics. One group photograph of the site-12 research team, prior to Incident [REDACTED].

Note: Just to cover all my bases. -Dr. Beiderman

Input: One bottle of Class-Y mnestics
Setting: 1:1
Output: One bottle of Class-B amnestics.

Input: One bottle of Class-Y mnestics
Setting: Fine
Output: One bottle containing a neon substance. Testing proved this to be a "super mnestic" It is probable that nobody who has been sprayed with this can ever be forgotten.

Mabye we colud use tis to remember 055! - Dr. Beiderman

Note: There is no 055 Beiderman. Have you been drinking? - Security Chief Ozark

Input: One bottle of Class-Y mnestics, One Photograph.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One empty bottle of Class-Y mnestics, One photograph of the members of Site 12 prior to incident [REDACTED]. The photograph cannot be destroyed, and produces a memetic effect causing viewers of the photograph to have awareness of who each person present is, how they died, and why they were unusual. Dr. Beiderman has been allowed to keep the photograph for aesthetic purposes.

Note: To those jolluy oled suols, may thay rest in peice! Godd sped, gentts! -Dr. Beiderman

Note: If anybody would like to talk to Dr. Beiderman, he can be found sobering up in the Site drunk tank. I understand his pain, but alcohol is not the solution. That said, anybody want these two kegs of lager I confiscated from him? - Security Chief Ozark

Note: Veritas might -Intern Lunar

Note: I'd rather have Beidermans testing clearance for a while. I'm suspending amnestics testing for the time being. I'd like to avoid the scenario where we all wake up without knowing where and who we are. The only reason that I haven't kicked him out yet is previous test results. - Veritas

Test 914-0672
Name: Junior Researcher Stan
Date: 25/04/2019
Total Items: One bottle of red wine, one jar of moonshine

Note: Doing a test to see what alcohols commonly associated with countries will result in. Not sure what the cheap wine will do, but it should be interesting. Don’t ask where I got the moonshine. - Stan

Input: Bottle of wine
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Seemingly unchanged bottle of wine. When investigated, the label claimed that the wine had been “aged 100 yeers. (sic)” The wine appeared to have been rapidly fermented during the transformation. Samples showed that the yeasts had become toxic and the wine was unsafe for consumption.

Note: I was hoping for an ancient Greek or maybe a French joke. - Stan

Input: Jar of moonshine
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Seemingly unchanged bottle of moonshine. Lab testing could not find anything toxic or potentially dangerous about it. (Excluding the extremely high alcohol content)

Note: Knowing 914, anything that is “Seemingly” unchanged is generally more dangerous than the more obvious outputs. To determine what was changed, we’re going to have a D-Class take shots of extremely powerful alcohol, because caution was thrown to the wind long ago. - Stan

D-3568 was placed into a testing room with a table holding five shot glasses of the output moonshine. D-3568 smelled the contents of the shot glasses and became visibly more excited and willing to continue with the test. Subject was then instructed to drink one shot and showed signs of mild intoxication after 15 minutes. D-3568 continued to drink the moonshine and became further intoxicated. The subject was noted to begin speaking in a slurred southern United States accent which intensified as the subject’s blood alcohol content increased. Once all of the shot glasses had been consumed, the D-Class went on to yell and rant about the Foundation in a stereotypical “southern” accent, using many mannerisms they previously did not use. This behavior went on for roughly 10 minutes, at which point the subject vomited, attempted to sing “Country Roads”, and blacked out. After recovery, D-3568 retained a slight accent and continued use of a few mannerisms and slang.

Note: Even though half of his arguments were ad hominems or unintelligible, he made a few good points. - Stan

Note: The jar has gone missing. Anyone caught talking like a Texan will face disciplinary action, specifically the ones not being raised Texan. - Veritas

Note: mah darn cat spilled that moonshine on this here keyboard, and now I need a gosh darn new one. -Intern Lunar

Note: got a new keyboard and It looks like the cat steals stuff. Don't leave out liquids you don't want being moved. If someone wants 25 kazoos back tell me. -Intern Lunar

Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 25/04/2019
Total Items: 5 2.6-ounce bottles of 2-stroke engine oil, refined to remove 99.9% of impurities.

Note: What? I'm not a complete instrument junkie. Gimme a break. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 bottle
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of shredded plastic.

Note: Wait a second. Where'd the oil go? -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 bottle
Setting: Coarse
Output: A 4"x7" sheet of plastic, consistent with the make of the bottle.

Note: Okay, I double-checked to make certain these bottles weren't empty when I put them in. What's going on here, 914? -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 bottle
Setting: 1:1
Output: A bottle marked as "3-stroke engine oil." Contents missing.

Note: Okay, not surprising anymore, just… inexplicable. 914 can't create or destroy matter, so what the hell's going on here? Also, how the hell would a 3-stroke engine even work? -Prof. Wren

Input: One quart
Setting: Fine
Output: A bottle of similar size; further testing revealed it can somehow contain up to 3.9 ounces of fluid. Contents missing.

Note: I have a theory. Somehow a quantum anomaly has occurred within 914; perhaps the oil will all simply come back in the final test? -Prof. Wren

Input: One quart
Setting: Very fine
Output: A plastic origami rose. Upon the output booth opening, a deep, resonating, and very loud sound was heard, lasting 1.38 seconds. All personnel on site who heard the sound described it as a belch.

Note: Well then… … …I think we just got our answer on where the oil went. I swear, just when this machine's starting to make something remotely resembling sense, [EXPLETIVE] like this happens. -Prof. Wren

Note: Watch your blood pressure dear. I feel it is now safe to assume when materials used in maintenance of a machine are put though 914, it will perform self maintenance. Remember when MT Johnson told it to give itself a tune up? I feel it is safe to assume you are now one of its favorite researchers. Now, how to test that… - Dr. Beiderman

Note: I'm willing to bet that's what the rose was for. Beyond that, I feel it is never safe to assume anything with this machine. $20 says the next test I run with this ends in disaster. -Prof. Wren

Setting: Fine
Output: A copy of the U.S. constitution. Subject spins rapidly and uncontrollably around its spine. After some difficulty immobilizing the subject, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment was found to be missing.

Note: That's… a little creepy. I hope this thing isn't plotting some kind of coup. -Researcher Simonson

Input: A copy of JJBA: SBR.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An intricate wooden figurine of a mummified corpse with holes in each hand. When placed on a flat surface, subject turned to face east. Personnel who carried weapons were repelled by the subject.

Total items: One handgun and a Samsung smart fridge.

Input: One handgun
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A handgun. If fired at a person, all of their mass will be transformed into a bubble.

Note: None of the D Class said they didn't like it. That's because they all popped before I could get their opinion. -Terren

Input: One Samsung smart fridge
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A machine labeled “Darby Regeneration Center.”

Note: The Darby Regeneration Center has been put in storage for now. If we want to test the Darby Regeneration Center then it would risk losing Darby. -Terren.

Note: Or we could see what happens using a skin sample -Intern Lunar

Note: Absolutely not. I ran out of the stuff that Beiderman gave me and we have no guarantee that that thing won't function as a clone bay or something. I moved it to anomalous storage. Don't ask where, I'm not telling you. - Veritas

Note: You ran out?! How did you manage that? That had two hundred 1 hour doses! It’s been two days! - Beiderman

Items: 3 suitcases, brown leather, silver hardware, nameplate Dr. Peters

Note: In keeping with before, I am familiarizing myself with SCP-914 (and vice versa) in preparation of tissue sample testing. Also, it would appear no one coordinated for my birthday so I have a few duplicates to run through.

Input: 1 suitcase as above
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 black leather backpack

Note: Not my style, but quite nice

Input: One suitcase as above
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 leather suit case containing a silver coat hanger. The hanger is markedly weak, probably due to the small amount of metal it had to work with.

Note: Well that's literal.

Input: One suitcase as above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Unchanged Exhibits the anomalous property of removing the strongest emotion currently being experienced whenever held

Note: Really 914? Another pun? Also, at the risk of sounding unprofessional, Darby may want to keep this near in preparation of the next time he runs afoul Dr. Veritas.

Test 914-0678

Items: 3 copies of The Bible

Input: 1 Bible
Setting: Rough
Output: Shredded paper and book binding

Input: 1 Bible
Setting: 1:1
Output: The Bibble, every b in the book is doubled

Note: I fail to see how this is useful - Dr. Matism

Input: 1 Bible
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The Bible. Exposure to it causes anyone who reads it to have advanced knowledge of the Catholic church, including undisclosed Vatican secrets.

Note: No, just no. I didn't need to know what they're actually doing with the Notre Dame money - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0679
Name: Researcher Festiv
Date: 25/04/2019
Item: one note reading "what happened to Darby?"

Note: we used the Dar-Be-Gon on Darby after realising that if he does die for good, we can just use the Darby regeneration center. When we sprayed him with it he just dissipated into thin air, this is to see if we can get a response from 914 as to what happened to him. not expecting much though… -Researcher Festiv

Input: The note
Setting: 1:1
Output: Extremely faded Product Recall notice for "Dar-Be-Gon", on back of the notice was a drawing of 914's dial switched to very fine

Note: Okay… I'll go grab it - Researcher Festiv

Input: "Dar-Be-Gon"
Setting: Very Fine
Output: "Dar-Be-Ceen", when Researcher Festiv picked up the bottle it was yanked out off his hands by an unseen force and proceeded to release its content in the air creating a cloud of cleaning solution. When cloud cleared it revealed Researcher Darby standing there holding the bottle and covered in chemical burns from the extreme acidity of the reaction between "Dar-Be-Ceen" and "Dar-Be-Gon". Researcher Darby was sent to the ICU for chemical burns and the "Dar-Be-Ceen" has been destroyed.

Note: I don't what was in that "Dar-Be-Gon" but I couldn't touch anything, say anything, or interact in any way. It's like I was a ghost but I couldn't haunt anyone, I think I may need some personal time after that. - Researcher Darby

Note: I suggest in the future we refrain from actively murdering researchers just because we have an untested machine we think will clone them. -Lombardi

Note: I have to agree with Lombardi on this one. At this point I am going to run out of "914 Brand Pain Killers" to give Researcher Darby and I don't entirely know if they are non-addictive. -Doctor S.

Test 914-0680
Name: Dr. Peters
Date: 26/04/2019
Items: 5 cans of [REDACTED] brand sweet whole kernel corn

Note: Continuing on, I have gained some familiarity with SCP-914 and as such will start working towards tissue samples in incremental steps.

Input: One can as described above.
Setting: Rough
Output: Irregular block of aluminum, Pile of fibrous slush

Input: One can as described above.
Setting: Coarse
Output: Small, hollow sphere of aluminum open at the top similar to a fish bowl, filled with water. Next to the sphere is a fibrous sheet approximately the size of an A4 printer sheet

Note: That's promising, but I've read too many 914 reports to get my hopes up. Dr. Peters

Input: One can as described above.
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 can of [REDACTED] brand green beans

Note: I'd call that an improvement, but to each their own. - Dr. Peters

Input: One can as described above.
Setting: Fine
Output: One aluminum bowl filled with pico de gallo.

Note: It only looks like pico de gallo, it seems 914 couldn't make lime nor cilantro from corn. However, I added some of my own and it's not bad. If you want to try some I've left it in the break room with chips. - Dr. Peters

Input: One can as described above.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small hearing aid, analysis shows the bulk of materials were replaced with densely compacted fibrous material with the aluminum replacing internal wirings. Displays the anomalous property of translating visible electromagnetic wavelengths into sounds. When given to a D-class they described the overhead lights as similar to a high note similar to a flute whereas the blinking red from the camera was like a quiet foghorn. fMRI scanning was aborted immediately after initiation when the D-class thrashed and ripped out the device. Testing showed complete loss of hearing in the ear wearing the device, though the ear canal was physically intact.

Note: Further research shows my error, fMRI works not only with magnetic fields, but with sharp, strong bursts of radio frequency. It seems my assumption this only worked with the visible light spectrum was incorrect. Professor Wren, any interest in experimenting with this? - Dr. Peters

Note: Seemed like a neat experiment, thought I'd see what my results were. -Prof. Wren

Input: All of the above.
Setting: Fine
Output: A small clockwork octopus.

Note: Upon the booth opening, a number of long, thin chocolate "tentacles" erupted from the device and attempted to ensnare Prof. Wren. She responded by smashing the device under her heel, stating that she'd "seen enough hentai to know where that was going" before doing so. Upon its destruction, the device erupted a sizable quantity of chocolate all over her.

Note: Dr. Veritas, I am formally requesting deletion of the security footage of this test and amnestics for anyone who saw it. Also, a towel. -Prof. Wren

Note: Way ahead of you, Wren. - Veritas

Total Items: 5 ███████ brand chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch.

Note: I realized after reading Wren's log that I forgot to add my Easter collaboration experiment to the collab log itself, so here's what happened. Hint: bees. -Stan

Input: Above
Setting: Fine
Output: Multiple clockwork honeybees, powered by an unknown source and flying using methods commonly found in ornithopters. The bees quickly became inanimate due to the high heat production from inefficient design melting the chocolate components.

Note: Thankfully, no one was stung during the incident, but I did get a lot of chocolate on me. - Stan

Note: Seen as though it now seems customary for all researchers to repeat this exact experiment, I might as well take part. Besides, I have a way with clocks. -Dr Clocks

Input: Above mentioned items
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One miniature bust of Dr Clocks' head, made entirely out of chocolate. Text is written underneath, stating 'You're late. I'm not paying for those.'.

Note: I didn't even buy them, you'll be surprised by how much the Foundation actually funds my work… it's actually not that much. -Dr Clocks

Test 914-0684
Name: Dr. N████ Trandfir
Date: 26/04/2019
Total Items: 5 ███████ brand chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch.

Note: I've got nothing better to do. -Dr. Trandfir

Input: All above items
Setting: Fine
Output: One animate chocolate cat, life-sized, with a collar made of various watch parts. Object displays intelligence and behavior on par with an average non-anomalous house cat. Object displays no other anomalous abilities.

Note: Submitting request to keep specimen. -Dr. Trandfir

Note: It's made of chocolate, that thing won't survive a summer's day. Be my guest though, just don't complain about the mess. - Veritas

Test 914-0685
Name: Jr. Researcher Ija Rasclon (thrice), D-3127
Date: 26/04/2019
Items: Three Two iron cubes, measuring 3cm on each side. JR. Rasclon (twice).

Note: This is an experiment I've been itching to try. I want to test the projection of ideas into 914's input, and how that differs from placing objects in it. I'll start with generic, meaningless objects for now. -JR. Rasclon

Input: One iron cube, mental image of iron cube projected by D-3127
Setting: 1:1
Output: One iron sphere, of the same mass and volume as the cube. D-3127 reported their mental image changed into a sphere as well, without being told of the physical result prior. They also reported a feeling of mild nausea due to this.

Note: So far, it seems that the image will change in the same way as the object, at least on 1:1. Let's test on higher settings. -JR. Rasclon

Input: See previous input.
Setting: Fine
Output: One iron sphere, of the same mass and volume as the cube. D-3127 reported a feeling of distress and an inability to discern between cubes and spheres, with all cubic objects in their sight and mind appearing as spheres. This effect was neutralised by amnestics.

Note: Fine seems to have made additional "improvements" to the mental image of the cube, rather than the cube itself. Interesting. Tentatively going for Very Fine next. -JR. Rasclon

Note: The next test happened spontaneously after the dial on 914 was set to Very Fine. Both the input and output emerged simultaneously from their respective booths. JR. Rasclon from up to this point in the test will now be referred to as Rasclon 1.

Input: Jr. Researcher Ija Rasclon, hereafter referred to as Rasclon 2. Rasclon 2 was unable to keep their balance and began to crawl away from 914, seemingly repelled from the object by some kind of force.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Jr. Researcher Ija Rasclon, hereafter referred to as Rasclon 3.

Note: What? -Rasclon 1

Note: .niaga siht ton ,sdog hO -Rasclon 2

Note: To reiterate, what? -Rasclon 1

Note: Rasclon 3 proceeded to grab Rasclons 1 and 2, and shove them both into 914, stating "Not explaining, you'll figure it out when you're me in about 30 seconds."

Note: ?!tahW ?tahw -ni tahW -Rasclon 2

Input: Rasclon 1.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Rasclon 2.

Note: Once 914 was activated, both Rasclons 1 and 2 disappeared. Rasclon 3 later admitted herself to the infirmary, giving the reason "Cause and effect is fucked and I have a migraine." Due to the absence of an acting researcher, the remaining test was suspended indefinitely. Rasclon 3 will now return to being referred to as Jr. Researcher Ija Rasclon.

Note: 914 reversed my direction of travel through time. Twice. Is putting living organisms through 914 still an issue if I'm doing it to stop the timeline from screwing itself? You know what, I don't care. The consequences of my - do they count as actions? The possible consequences of my maybe-actions can find me in the infirmary, but I maintain that everything I did was temporally necessitated by 914. Time travel is bullshit. -Rasclon

Test 914-0686
Name: Researcher Z. Larua
Date: 26/04/2019
Total Items: 5 Black Top-Hats

Input: 1 Hat
Setting: Rough
Output: Shredded fabric

Input: 1 Hat
Setting: Coarse
Output: 100 miniature top-hats

Input: 1 Hat
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 Black leather cowboy hat

Input: 1 Hat
Setting: Fine
Output: A signet ring bearing an unfamiliar design. When worn on either hand, it produces an anomalous effect similar to if the wearer was wearing sunglasses. The strength of the sun-blocking effect is strongest when the ring is worn on the ring finger. This effect is also capable of allowing the wearer to look directly at the sun for roughly ten seconds before the effect begins to weaken.

Input: 1 Hat
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A black smoke-like ethereal scarf that is only corporeal when not worn or only to the wearer. Wearing this scarf causes it to conform to the wearer's height, drooping along their back long enough to always reach their waist. Occasionally, the smoke from the scarf will make the wearer appear as if they are wearing a suit from the early 1900s. Whether this is an actual formation of the smoke or an anomalous optical effect is uncertain. Contact with the ethereal scarf or the wearer causes people to enter a trance-like state, wherein they act as if they are close friends with the wearer. The possessed would willingly perform any task for the wearer and actively protect them against any threat. It was also observed that the longer the scarf was worn and people were possessed, the more their speech would regress to match early 1900s dialects. Once the wearer removes the scarf, the possessed revert back to normal with no memory of their time possessed. Speech effects linger slightly, but dissipate within a minute.

Note: Originally I was worried about convincing the D-Class to remove the scarf since it was non-corporeal. However, he willingly removed it after around 15 to 20 minutes of testing claiming that he was beginning to lose consciousness and felt something 'pulling on his mind'. -Larua

Test 914-0687
Name: Dr. Sheath
Date: 26/04/2019
Total Items: 5 ███████ brand chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch

Note: Alright, I'll throw my hat in the ring too. The more data on different results, the better, right? - Dr. Sheath

Input: Above items
Setting: Fine
Output: One solid, featureless cube of chocolate matching the mass of the five chocolate bunnies, one seemingly unchanged pocket watch. Upon retrieving the chocolate cube, any skin in contact began changing in composition to chocolate. This effect spread across Dr. Sheath's hand and arm for seven minutes until the pocket watch was opened from the back. The speed of the pocket watch appeared to determine the speed the chocolate spread, and by reversing the pocket watch's time, the chocolate was able to be removed from Dr. Sheath's body, leaving no traces. Both items have been destroyed without issue.

Note: I don't want this to be what 914 does with me. The Lego hand is bad enough. This isn't how I want to be remembered. -Dr. Sheath

Note: Might I suggest procuring a pair of protective gloves? - Dr. Peters

Test 914-0688
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 23/04/2019
Total items: Documents pertaining to SCP-2599 (Zena Cho), Wikipedia page of Hyo-Won Woo, music sheet of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 in A major, one copy of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith

Input: Documents, Wikipedia page, Symphony No. 7
Setting: Fine
Output: A music sheet titled “Symphony No. 4 in E♭ major, Op. 13”, ostensibly composed by Zena Cho; and a Wikipedia page of Zena Cho. The Wikipedia page described her as a classical music artist with a perfectionist personality, who struggled with completion in her works.

Note: Not far from her actual personality to be honest. Keeping the music sheet for this symphony in the break room. I'll be glad if something could be arranged to perform it. - Dr. Cleveland

Input: Wikipedia page output, Revenge of the Sith
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Wikipedia pages of the years 1977 and 2005, and a copy of Revenge of the Sith where all actors and actresses are replaced with Korean celebrities active in 2004. The former is not anomalous. The latter, when viewed, it produces a memetic effect where the viewer believes the background music is derived from Korean traditional music. In 15 percent of cases, all affecting women, the viewer would demand the release of SCP-2599 from what they refer to as "political imprisonment".

Note: Political imprisonment? Since when did the Foundation represent any government? I'm confused. - Dr. Cleveland

Test 914-0689
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 26/04/2019
Total Items: 3 Fender Stratocaster guitars, 3 Fender guitar amplifiers

Note: As fun as that octopus might have been, I think I'm gonna go back to music-based experiments for a little while. Lesson learned there: Fine may be safer than Very Fine, but some precautions should still be taken nonetheless. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 guitar, 1 amp.
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 Gibson Les Paul guitar, 1 Gibson guitar amplifier.

Note: Wouldn't have been my first choice, 914, but I can respect that. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 guitar, 1 amp.
Setting: Fine

Note: Just to play it safe, having a D-class get the results this time. -Prof. Wren

Output: A larger, heavier Stratocaster guitar. The face of the body is constructed out of a speaker and has the amplifier's control knobs on the back side. Amp jack replaced with the amplifier's power cord; functions properly when connected to power.

Note: Testing was paused for 5 minutes while Prof. Wren performed a cover of Eric Clapton's "Layla." Audio recordings have been made available for personnel.

Note: Now that's how that song is supposed to sound! Way better than that bell-guitar from the other day. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 guitar, 1 amp.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A large chest colored like the Stratocaster. Chest is kept shut by a combination lock styled after the amp's control knobs. Upon being opened, a DVD labeled "Sing, Cover, Perform" was found inside. Analysis of the disc found an anomalous property wherein a purely instrumental version of whatever song the person who presses Play is thinking of at the time will start, complete with on-screen lyrics as needed. Additionally, whoever induces the anomaly will find themselves compelled to sing the song in question; no improvements in singing ability have been documented.

Note: Good lord. Compulsory karaoke…I honestly don't know whether to be pleased or mortified. -Prof. Wren

- Hide 069X Test Logs
Test 914-0690
Name: Dr Clocks
Date: 27/04/2019
Total Items: One CD titled, 'The greatest hits of Madness'

Input: One CD
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One DVD titled 'The greatest hits of the SCP Foundation'. This DVD contains several altered pieces of music made by Madness. A few of the changes are shown below:
'Our House' now instead shows what would be a regular day instead the SCP Foundation, showing many famous researchers and agents working with and containing certain SCPs.
'House of Fun' now shows and describes the 914 testing logs. This includes almost all the 914 testing logs up to this point.
'Driving in my Car' instead shows several GOIs and POIs driving in a large jeep with it ending with all of them leaving the vehicle and entering Site-19.
'Baggy Trousers' details a Site-Wide containment breaches of Site-19 and Site-17.
Finally, 'Shut Up' shows multiple cognitohazardous and memetic SCPs escaping from multiple MTF units.

Test 914-0691
Name: Dr. Nukea
Date: 27/04/2019
Input: Seventeen copies of 17 again

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A plastic humanoid who attacked Nukea. Dr. Nukea was terminated.

Note: It is extremely sad to lose a friend like Nukea. I will miss him and his love for 17 again. -Tamsen

Note: Casualties happen at the foundation. But this one really makes me depressed. I’ll miss you Nukea. -Terren

Note: Nukea’s funeral will be on 30/04/2019. I’ll see you all there. -Thompson

Note: Why do all the cool researchers have to die? -Harvey the ll

Note: What should we do with the bag? I feel like it should be buried with him. It is his most prized possession. -Scott

Note: There will be a memorial film night on 04/05/2019, dedicated to Dr. Alexander Nukea and 17 Again. All will be welcome. His legacy shall live on, and shall eternally be among us. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: I'm surprised he even lasted this long. - Dr. Trandfir

Note: I will be attending both the funeral, and the memorial film… this is a day of mourning for the SCP-914 researchers. - Dr. Somhas

Note: rest in peace my good friend, may you be forever be remembered as a fellow researcher. I will also be attending the movie and the funeral too.

Note: As will I. I may not have personally known him all that well, but he was one of us. - MT Johnson

Note: I haven't been here long, but I'm still saddened by this. I propose we put the bag of 17 again through 914 on Rough in memorial of Nukea. -JR. Rasclon.

Note: His shenanigans were legendary, and even though I never met him, I'll be attending his funeral and the memorial film too. May he rest in peace… and may I request that we do a 17-gun salute? -Researcher Gailen

Note: I never got a chance to work with Nukea, but it's gonna be a sadder kind of weird here after this. Vaya con Dios, friend. -Prof. Wren

Note: I'm sad to see Nukea gone. Seemed like he was the only one who could get back at 914 for all of the mayhem it causes. You can expect to see me at his funeral. - Junior Researcher Stan.

Note: No one is wondering how a plastic figurine managed to- fine, I guess I owe him that much. - Veritas

Note: Goodbye Nukea. I respected you, and your work. You will be dearly missed by all of us. Gute Reise - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0692
Name: Researcher Gailen
Date: 27/04/2019
Total Items: Three copies of the D&D module Tomb of Horrors 3.5th edition.

Note: I finally made some more testing time. Also, I request that the guards be equipped with water guns and the water gun sniper rifle from a previous test in the case of the module animating into a paper gargoyle or something like that. -Researcher Gailen

Input: One Tomb of Horrors module
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Tomb of Annihilation module

Input: One Tomb of Horrors module
Setting: Fine
Output: One origami figurine of each species of monsters in the Tomb of Horrors, excluding Acererak, made from the pages of the module.

Note: Requesting to keep all of these, the attention to detail is amazing and I'd like to use them in an actual campaign if possible. -Researcher Gailen

Input: One Tomb of Horrors module
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Upon the output booth door opening, an animate origami recreation of Acererak the Demi-Lich from the Tomb of Horrors module emerged. The figure began laughing maniacally before raising its hands and drawing in every piece of paper in the room towards itself, absorbing them upon contact. Security personnel in the room began shooting it with water guns, causing visible damage to Acererak. The figurine, estimated to be 1.5 meters tall at this point, turned towards the guards and began turning pieces of paper into several slivers of paper, which were then hurled at the guards and Researcher Gailen before being shot in the head by a guard using the water gun sniper rifle. Minor paper-cuts were dealt to 3 Security Personnel and Researcher Gailen.

Note: Acererak's quest for knowledge spanned to this world as well, albeit momentarily. A terrifying thing to behold even if it's only paper. Also, ouch. -Researcher Gailen

Test 914-0693
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 28/04/2019
Total Items: 5 kilograms of wood, 200 grams of steel, A piece of paper reading “Olive the peridot cat”

Note: Let’s see if 914 can make something for Olive. - Jane Cho

Input: Wood, Steel, Paper
Setting: Fine
Output: A large cylindrical barrel-like container with an opening through the wall at the bottom. A handle- like appendage is present on one side. A folded piece of paper reading “Jeff the mug cat” is present above the opening. Notably, the opening is too small for Olive to pass through.

Note: What. - Jane Cho

Note: Can I have that? -Intern Lunar

Note: If you want to keep Jeff in there, you probably would need to put in things like a food bowl and a litterbox too. Olive doesn’t eat or poo, so I didn’t have to worry about them. - Jane Cho

Test 914-0694
Name: Researcher A. Sakayuki
Date: 28/04/2019
Total Items: 5 ███████ brand chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch.

Note: I hope this doesn't turn out like the original experiment…

Input: All of the above.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small humming-bird made of chocolate. The chocolate eggs appear to have no anomalous properties. However, despite the bird being made of chocolate, it functions extremely similarly to an ordinary hummingbird. It lays roughly 12 chocolate eggs a day when fed with sugar, coco powder and milk.

Note: I need this thing in my office. It's chocolate and a pet combined! - Dr. Aurora Sakayuki

Note: Don't expect it to last long. It'll probably end up melting. - Dr. Trandfir

Note: I'll keep the AC on… that'll work, right? - Dr. Aurora Sakayuki

Test 914-0695
Name: Dr. Artium
Date: 28/04/2019
Total Items: One copy of "Borderlands", One copy of "Borderlands 2", One copy of "Tales From the Borderlands", Three ███████ brand laptops

Note: It has been a while since my last test with 914. I decided to continue with a similar string of tests involving video games with multiple random and different items to test possible 914 output's. - Dr. Artium

Input: One copy of "Borderlands", One ███████ brand laptop
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An small animate figure of the character "CL4P-TP", upon exiting the output booth it greeted Dr. Artium by saying "Hello Traveler!!" it then proceeded to speak with Dr. Artium for two minutes before deciding to dance. Upon further examination of the output booth several components of the original laptop have been left apart most likely considered by 914 to be unnecessary.

Note: With permission I would like to keep this with me in my office for reasons of testing, excitement, and to maintain everyone's sanity. -Dr. Artium

Note: Artium, I'm telling you what I tell everyone. You can keep it, but don't complain when that thing starts shooting up your office on day 19. - Veritas

Input: One copy of "Borderlands 2", One ███████ brand laptop
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A mask resembling the face worn by the main antagonist of the game "Handsome Jack". Like the last test upon examination of the output booth there were multiple extraneous computer parts belonging to the original laptop.

Note: Jack was always my favorite video game villain, neat. Request to keep this in my office after examination of potential anomalous abilities? -Dr. Artium

Note: Read above. - Veritas

Input: One copy of "Tales From the Borderlands", One ███████ brand laptop
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A replica and seemingly working version of the "Echo Eye" used by the character "Rhys" Throughout the game. Strangely though, there was also an unfinished prosthetic arm belonging to said character.

Note: My colleagues, it is my intention to test this "Echo Eye" however I intend on being the subject. While this may seem unprofessional I believe that with the possible abilities that one could gain from the device makes it far too dangerous to implant into a D-Class subject, I have learned my lesson from the punch. I will write a report on the effects and abilities as soon as I can. -Dr. Artium

Note: Two hours after the conclusion of Doctor Artium's tests with 914 the "Echo Eye" was implanted into his left eye. Over the course of two weeks Dr. Artium has made significant progress in running test on the potential benefits of this new technology. However as of ██/██/██ Dr. Artium said that he has started seeing the character "Handsome Jack", most notably from the second game in the "Borderlands" franchise.

Note: I will admit it has been a surreal experience so far, especially now having Handsome Jack in my head. Surprisingly I am able to at the vary least tolerate him, and he has been some help in re calibrating the eye when a small error occurred. For right now I have no intentions of removing the "Handsome-AI" from the "Echo Eye". -Dr. Artium

Test 914-0696
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 28/04/2019
Total Items: 73 copies of the Gideons' Bible.

Note: Before anyone asks, these came from a Foundation-owned hotel that had been condemned for demolition after a containment breach by SCP-████. I did all the proper paperwork to get these. As for why I have so many… well, remember the outcome of that experiment with the amalgamated D20? I'm curious to see if we can replicate the results, show some consistency with 914 on at least the lower settings. -Prof. Wren

Input: All 73 Bibles.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One massive booklet, total mass equaling that of all 73 Bibles. Each page of the booklet contains 73 copies of a regular page of the Bible, some rotated in ways that allow them all to fit.

Note: About what I expected. If this goes like the dice experiment, this next one should give us 73 Bibles that each contain 73 copies of a single book. -Prof. Wren

Input: The previous output.
Setting: Coarse
Output: One 19kg sheet of faux leather, one 6589cm x 19cm roll of paper, 361 fluid ounces of ink, 19 ounces of gold-colored paint.

Note: Or not. In fairness, "disassemble and sort into piles" is pretty much what the Coarse setting does, so I guess this is still a bit of consistency. What truly interests me, though, is how the dimensions and masses are all powers of the number 19; the roll of paper is 19^3 cm long, while there's 19^2 ounces of ink. How serendipitous can you get? This may merit further research… -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0697
Name: Dr. McArthur
Date: 28/04/2019
Total Items: One glass vial of ferrofluid.

Note: Hey. New guy here. Let's hope this goes alright. -Dr. McArthur

Input: Aforementioned vial of ferrofluid
Setting: Fine
Output: One glass sphere filled with ferrofluid. Testing revealed that the ferrofluid is attracted to magnetic sources approximately 30 times more intense than normal ferrofluid.

Note: Neat. -Dr. McArthur

Note: Turns out, that thing attracts materials that usually aren't magnetic and it's hard to pry from any surface. We had the largest difficulty dislodging this thing from 914's output booth, where we found out that the thing is also attracted to bone, specifically the back of security officer Terren's skull. The helmet prevented serious damage, but Terren is in the infirmary with a concussion. Result incinerated. - Veritas

Test 914-0698
Name: Dr. Tamsen
Date: 28/04/2019
Total items: One cardboard cutout of Zac Efron and a copy of 17 again.

Note: I hope this will bring back Nukea. -Tamsen

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Fine
Outout: A cardboard cutout of Robert Downey Jr. with a huge plastic button on it. When pressed, a male voice will read the entire script of 17 again. The button is made from the same materials as a 17 again DVD box.

Note: Maybe I need to put it on Very Fine? -Tamsen

Note: There may be ways of playing God like that, but given their relationship I'd say 914 isn't the way to do it. Besides, 914 can't create or alter matter; at the absolute best you'd wind up sticking Nukea's soul in a miniature body made out of cardboard, plastic, and DVD. I'm more willing to bet 914 would just do something absolutely horrible, though. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0699
Name: Prof. Wren, D-914-613
Date: 28/04/2019
Input: 4 photos, 1 each of the following personnel: Darby, Calloway, Wren, and the late Dr. Nukea.

Note: As these tests will be conducted on Very Fine and involves researchers who have had…questionably safe interactions with 914 in the past, this test will be handled by a D-Class while everyone else is, hopefully, a safe distance away. -Prof. Wren

Input: Photo of Darby.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A photo of the backside of an equus africanus asinus (common donkey). Photo spontaneously exploded 14 seconds after booth opened. No injuries or damage reported.

Input: Photo of Calloway.
Setting: Very Fine
Setting: A blank photo. D-914-613 reported getting a song, later identified as "This Tune Is Annoying" from the "weebls stuff" website, stuck in his head upon picking the photo up. Anomaly persisted until 28 minutes after photo was released; D-class reports the anomalous effect ended immediately upon releasing the photo, but that "that [EXPLETIVE] song just wouldn't shut up" afterwards.

Input: Photo of Wren.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A photo with the number "19" written on it, in various numerical and literary forms, 19 times.

Input: Photo of the late Dr. Nukea.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The same photo, but in monochrome and with two black arcs over the upper corners, similar to Japanese funeral photos. An ASCII "frown" is visible in the lower-right corner.

Note: I wasn't expecting 914's actions with the Nukea photo to be so touching. Or for the "19" thing to pop up again…first it's origami, then weird instruments, now this number. Very strange. -Prof. Wren

Note: Maybe some type of warning, or something. -Intern Lunar

Note: In my experience, 914 doesn't do warnings. -Dr. Trandfir

Test 914-0700
Name: Junior Researcher Stan
Date: 28/04/2019
Total Items: One wooden Russian nesting doll

Input: Nesting doll
Setting: Fine
Output: A small wooden figure resembling Researcher Darby. Labeling states it is a "Russian nesting Darby." The doll splits vertically into consecutively smaller Darbys. The final doll contained a small inanimate wooden honeybee. Notably, the Darbys were painted and modeled to look further injured as the layers were opened, progressing into a nearly unrecognizable corpse.

Note: I'm not sure if 914 is threatening me or Darby, but either way it's terrifying. - Stan

Test 914-0701
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 28/04/2019
Total Items: One copy of the Green Day single "21 Guns", two copies of a photo of Dr. Nukea dated 27/03/2019, one AK-47

Input: AK-47
Setting: Fine
Output: Two LAR Grizzly Win Mag MkV pistols. Testing showed that all bullets fired from these pistols attain speeds of 3████ m/s.

Note: Grizzly, again? You've got to be kidding me. - Dr. Cleveland

Input: "21 Guns" single, photo of Dr. Nukea
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A single called "17 Guns", ostensibly by a band named "Suns of O'Donnel". The lead singer's voice has been confirmed to be that of Dr. Nukea, while two of the backing vocalists have been identified as Prof. Wren and Researcher Darby.

Note: I've heard the music, and I'm literally weeping right now! - Dr. Cleveland

Note: Good God but that man could sing! If we could isolate Nukea's vocals from this and Darby's up for it, I would love to perform this at the funeral. -Prof. Wren

Note: Normally I don't sing in front of people, but I can make an exception for Nukea. - Researcher Darby

Input: Photo of Dr. Nukea
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An animate photo with a note written at the back stating an expiration date of 05/05/2019. The photo contains a short message from the Grizzly entity (dressed in a black gown) to Dr. Nukea, stating that despite having never interacted with him beyond hello/goodbye, she believes that Dr. Nukea has "always been a kind person", and that he will "forever be missed". This message repeats itself once every three hours.
When asked, the entity stated that she does not know of the photo, but that her feelings are similar to that implicated by it. She also made a request to attend Dr. Nukea's funeral.

Note: I would like to propose renaming the break room in honor of Dr. Alexander Nukea. He deserved much more than he had. Everyone involved in 914 will remember him for his contributions. And I mean everyone, not just us researchers. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: Why is everyone making such a big deal over Nukea dying? We work at the foundation. Our saftey records are hardly infalliable; researchers dying here isn't exactly a rare occurance. - Dr. Trandfir

Note: How long did the others work on 914? How long did Nukea work here? Ask yourself, Trandfir, before you make such a heartless comment. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: The fact that our work is dangerous doesn't mean we have to be heartless about it. If anything it's all the more reason not to be. -Prof. Wren

Note: Sympathy isn't my strong suit. -Dr. Trandfir

Note: I never really met the man besides passing in the break room, but, he was a good man *Blows Nose* - Researcher Darby

Note: I'm pretty sure all he did was sit in his office and watch 17 again on loop. -Dr. Trandfir

Test 914-0702
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 29/04/2019
Total Items: One 800-piece puzzle depicting a flower, with 60 pieces missing

Note: The 60 pieces were stuffed inside Jeff the mug cat. Last time someone did an experiment with amnestics, Jeff appeared to have knowledge of SCP-914's experiment history. This is to test the hypothesis that they are somehow linked. - Jane Cho

Input: Puzzle
Setting: Fine
Output: A 800-piece puzzle depicting Intern Lunar placing a porcelain mug in the input booth with the former 'additional panels' set to "Animal". A different set of 60 pieces are missing.

Note: 914 appears to be able to see and depict past events. I am keeping this personally for additional testing, and verification of the picture's accuracy. - Jane Cho
Edit: This makes no sense. I wrapped duct tape around Jeff and locked him in a box to stop the pieces from falling out, but somehow the pieces ended up on my desk in an extremely damaged state. They're still part of the flower, by the way. - Jane Cho

Note: If any one sees Jane Cho with Jeff, stop her and tell me. I have told her about this and asked nicely for her to stop, yet she hasn't. I think Jeff is very angry right now as he dumped hot tea on my shoes again. Can someone watch my room or something so this doesn't happen again? thanks -Intern Lunar

Test 914-0703
Name: Prof. Wren, D-914-613
Date: 29/04/2019
Total Items: One synthesizer keyboard

Input: The synthesizer.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A synthesizer with 12 white keys and 7 black keys on it. D-class instructed to test the instrument out. The keys produced the following notes from left to right (number denotes octave, with 0 being the lowest the human ear can detect): E-flat 0, A-sharp 1, F 3, etc. Each key also had a progressive volume increase of 19 decibels and was accompanied by a 361hz square wave; D-class was given earplugs before pressing the 4th key, and sound dampening equipment was moved into the room before testing continued. D-class complained of an earache after pressing the 8th key, then began bleeding profusely from multiple facial orifices. D-class terminated, testing ceased. Upon being switched off, the synthesizer folded itself into a cube, 19cm in diameter on each side.

Note: 19 keys. A lowest note that plays at 19 hertz. Accounting for sharps and flats, each progressive key went up 19 notes from the previous. The volume went up 19 decibels with each key, and was accompanied by a square wave whose frequency was 19 squared. Its dimensions after powering down. At this point I'm not sure if I should be scared, or convinced that 914 is just [EXPLETIVE] with me. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0704
Name: Dr. Matism
Date: 29/04/2019
Total Items: 5 ███████ brand chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch

Note: Wow, everyone's bringing this back - Dr. Matism

Input: Above mentioned items
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An animate contraption resembling a very distorted rabbit. It approached Dr. Matism, Vocalizing, "Kill Me". Security guards terminated the subject, which exploded into various pieces of chocolate and clockwork

Note: I'm not gonna lie, that was disturbing. But that chocolate was some of the best I've ever had - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0705
Name: Dr. Matism
Date: 29/04/2019
Items: One copy of 17 Again

Input: One copy of 17 Again
Setting: Fine
Output: One DVD with a montage of funny and notable moments from Dr. Nukea's lifetime.

Note: I've had a member of Eta-10 scan for memetic hazards, and we're all good. Can I show this at Nukea's funeral? - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0706
Name: Dr Clocks
Date: 29/04/2019
Items: One note reading '19'

Note: Due to SCP-914 taking on a new approach, that being including '19' everywhere, I've decided to write a new test log on it. -Dr Clocks

Input: One note
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One note emblazoned with a single yellow star. The note appears to be emitting the song '19' by Paul Hardcastle, which seems induce PTSD upon those in its hearing range, with stronger cases held by those who have already fought in wars or other battles beforehand.

Note: This sadly does not prove anything on why SCP-914 has chosen this number, instead opting to cause more havoc, typical. -Dr Clocks

Test 914-0707
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 29/04/2019
Total Items: 60 heavily damaged puzzle pieces depicting part of a flower

Note: Let's see if 914 can turn them into the missing pieces of the new puzzle. - Jane Cho

Input: Puzzle pieces
Setting: Fine
Output: A small paper nameplate with the words "Junior Researcher Lunar" printed on it. Foundation personnel viewing said nameplate will be compelled to believe that Intern Lunar has been promoted to Junior Researcher on 29/04/2019.

Note: Apparently not. Also, 914 seems to reference Lunar a lot lately. - Jane Cho

Note: The memetic property of the item appears to have been absent immediately after the test. The security personnel who were present in the containment chamber during the test have not been exposed to the effect, despite security footage clearly showing them having visual contact with the item. Upon further inspection, this property has been proven to be the effect of a memetic pattern that was overlaid on the printed surface some time after the test. Exactly when or how this happened is unknown and is a subject of further investigation. Personnel are to be reminded that Lunar has never been officially hired by the Foundation. - Security Chief Ozark

Note: I blame Jeff for that, He has been behaving odd lately. If all goes well I will try to apply to be a Junior Researcher but for now I'm more than happy to be a intern -Intern Lunar

Test 914-0708
Name: Researcher Darby
Date: 29/04/2019
Total Items: One memorial letter for Researcher Nukea

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One letter addressed to Researcher Nukea. Address on said letter is "Apartment 17, 4539 Beezlebub Drive, Lower Hellpit, Hell" and the post mark on letter contains a minor cognitohazard that causes those who view it to attempt to deliver said letter.

Note: I opened the letter, or rather had a D-Class open the letter, and i'm going to read out its contents "Dear Nukea, due to a rather unfortunate series of events your application to 17 Again has been denied. Your constant use of black magic has made it impossible for you to pass your toxicity screening and be accepted through Immigration. If you still wish to Immigrate to 17 Again you must wait a period of 666 years and fill out forms 17-A-Bez-45, 17-B-Luc-69, and accompanying forms. The Government of 17 Again thanks you for your time and hopes to see you in the future". On another note, No one has died yet so maybe my curse has been broken? Well, Im going to be drowning my sorrows in the Break Room with a Pint of something British and Strong, anyone care to join me? - Researcher Darby

Note: The D-Class sent to open the letter has contracted a extremely virulent and contagious form of the Black Death and is expected to die within the next few hours. Researcher Darby and others who have been in contact have been put into quarantine and some other D-Class have contracted this plague. Dr. Veritas and Site Director Hackett have been notified about this epidemic and proper procedures are being initiated. - Medical Director of Site 19

Note: At this time, it is impossible to determine if the letter is genuine or that SCP-914 fabricated the result. Leave that to the philosophers. And of course, when you think he can't surprise you, Darby almost infects the Site with the Bubonic Plague. - Veritas

Note: Fortunately, we have a near-literal unlimited supply of antibiotics - Dr. Matism

Note: Maybe we should stop putting 17 again into this thing -Dr. Mensa

Test 914-0709
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 29/04/2019
Items: 1 front passenger side door from a 2001 Ford Explorer.

Note: We've had 13 instances of the number 19 crop up in my experiments the past few days; I can't tell if Dr. Clocks' instance was part of whatever's causing this or the result of inputting something with a 19 on it, so for the purposes of my own notes I'm leaving it out. 914's interactions have shown to vary from researcher to researcher anyway, so I'm fairly sure this is somehow aimed at me. Either way, let's see if 914 can keep that crap up with something completely random. As for how I got this? Nothing major, cost me $80 at a junkyard. -Prof. Wren

Input: The door.
Setting: Fine
Output: A metal case made out of the metal of the door, held shut by the door lock and handle. Inside was a katana 1.329m in length. Analysis of the blade shows it was somehow folded 19 times, leaving it highly durable but with no usable edge. The handle is wrapped in leather made from the inner door handle.

Note: 1.329 meters comes out to 52.31 inches, or, to get exact, 4.35889894 feet…which, you guessed it, is the square root of 19. Additionally, I measured the case it came in, and wouldn't you know it, it's 361 cubic inches in size…19 squared. That brings my own count of "19" instances up to 16. I'm beginning to get rather excited about what will happen when it gets up to the 19th… I also just noticed the blade has some markings on it that resemble a music line with notes on it. Between that and the "folding metal" construction, that also throws in the recurring themes of music and origami. Interesting. In any case, given that it's not sharp enough to cut warm butter, requesting permission to keep it for decorative purposes. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0710
Name: Dr. Matism
Date: 29/04/2019
Items: 1 kg of ground beef

Note: Testing cleared - 05-█

Input: 1 kg of ground beef
Setting: Fine
Output: A model of an empty foothill, the words Ground Beef are seared into the meat.

Note: Oh, ground as in the floor, ground beef. This was utterly pointless - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0711
Name: Dr. Peters
Date: 29/04/2019
Items: 6 portions of 30 grams of table salt

Note: Due to the inherent unpredictability regarding SCP-914, I have abandoned my original line of inquiry. Having said that, I have no intentions to cease experimentation with SCP-914. Instead, I am going back to simple with table salt. I am skipping rough and coarse to avoid the possibility of chlorine gas.

Input: 1 portion of salt as above
Setting: 1:1
Output: 30 grams rock salt

Note: Keeping it simple doesnt provide for much variation as expected. Now a repeat for confirmation. -Dr Peters

Input: 1 portion of salt as above
Setting: 1:1
Output: 30 grams pickling salt

Note: SCP-914 only changed the size of the crystals for these two tests, I would expect some crystaline structure changes on the fine setting. -Dr Peters

Input: 1 portion of salt as above
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 Cube of salt

Input: 1 portion of salt as above
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 tetrahedron of salt, microscopic analysis shows the crystal structure has been forced from cubic to tetrahedral. Specimen has been sent to the geology department for further analysis.

Note: Just when I feel I'm starting to find a trend it unravels, how did it create a stable change in the crystal structure? I will have to await the geology department's report. -Dr Peters

Input: 1 portion of salt as above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 salt viking weilding an axe that, when the output opened, leapt out and began swinging at the face of the D-class charged with collecting the specimens. Specimen was destroyed when Dr. Peters dumped a full mug of coffee over it.

Note: Good thing salt dissolves in water. I'm going to need more coffee if 914 keeps giving me puns though. -Dr. Peters

Test 914-0712
Name: Junior Researcher Stan
Date: 29/04/2019
Total Items: One note reading "I love you 3000."

Input: Above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A cognitohazardous picture of SCP-3000 that bore similar, albeit considerably weakened effects to the actual SCP. There was a doodle of a "heart" next to SCP-3000. It took two hours and 10 agents, but the image was eventually burned.

Note: I woke up in the amnestics bay with a bunch of agents. I don't remember what happened, and I had to piece this together using what was left of security footage. I don't have a wife and daughter, but my memory says otherwise. Requesting a short leave while I try to figure out what memories are mine and what aren't. - Evan Stan

Test 914-0713
Name: Dr. Beiderman
Date: 29/04/2019
Total Items: One photograph of Dr. Beiderman.

Input: Above
Setting: Fine
Output: One crumpled photograph of Researcher Darby. Exited booth at speeds upward of 120 M.P.H. and passed straight through Dr. Beiderman, who was pronounced dead when medical personnel arrived. Of note, Dr. Beiderman did not appear to have human organs when dissection began. Investigation into the fate of the "real" Dr. Beiderman, if there ever was one, is ongoing.

Note: Right under my nose… I quit. - Security Chief Ozark

Note: Really? If so do you want a goodbye present? -Intern Lunar

Note: Lunar, I am afraid he is already gone. Walked into the medbay muttering something about "body-snatchers" and popped the little white pill before I could stop him. - Medical Officer Lawrence

Note: Oh, goodness. We've lost two relatively high-profile researchers in three days, and then Ozark as well… - Dr. Cleveland

Test 914-0714
Name: Dr. Cleveland, D-5808
Date: 29/04/2019
Total Items: A sketch of SCP-085 in the Austrian Alps (i.e. not SCP-085 itself); a photo of Dr. Cleveland; a photo of Junior Researcher Rasclon; a copy of the Owl City EP Of June

Input: Sketch
Setting: Fine
Output: A monochrome photo of a woman skiing near Graz, Austria, dated 08/08/2008. The appearance of the woman matches that of Cassy as depicted by SCP-978.

Note: Someone is going to have to look up surveillance footage dated August 8, 2008… - Dr. Cleveland

Input: Photo of Dr. Cleveland
Setting: Fine
Output: A photo of Dr. Cleveland travelling in Riga, Latvia, prior to joining the Foundation. The photo was dated 19/04/2013, with "19" being in boldface. The photo has a memetic property which causes people to remember what they were doing exactly four years before joining the Foundation, and what they were doing exactly nineteen years ago, as vividly as possible.

Note: That would be the eighteenth time "19" shows up. I have to wonder… - Dr. Cleveland

Note: Why do I remember a firing squad aiming at me? I feel that I would remember that normally - Researcher Darby

Input: Photo of JR Rasclon
Setting: Fine
Output: A cognitohazardous photo depicting three JR Rasclons mauling one another. When viewed, the viewer splits into three entities. The effect lasts for nine hours before two of them vanish.

Note: That's why we need to use D-class. I am not going to risk splitting myself into three. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: Having seen the results of other recurring themes, I really hope this doesn't become one. 9 being 3^2, it seems similar to Prof. Wren's recurring "19", which so far seems fairly benign. That said, I'll be refraining from winding the mainspring for a few days. -JR. Rasclon

Input: Of June
Setting: Fine
Output: A CD, containing a recording dated 06/06/2026. The recording details (purportedly the President of the United States) Elizabeth Warren's reaction to a series of nuclear strikes.
From the recording, the targets were as follows:
Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada: On target causing widespread destruction. No other information is known.
Missoula, Montana: Off target, destroying Clear Water, Montana but heavily irradiating Missoula in the process. SCP-3300 presumed neutralized as a side effect.
Butte, Montana: On target, Silver Bow County obliterated.
Pocatello, Idaho: Off target, hitting Fort Hall, Idaho but failed to explode due to a preemptive EMP attack encompassing all communities from Pocatello to Idaho Falls.
Evanston, Wyoming: On target, Uinta County in complete anarchy.
Grand Junction, Colorado: Shot down. Four people are killed by debris.
Durango, Colorado: On target but failed to explode. Eight people are killed in the impact.
Moab, Utah: Shot down. No casualties were reported.
Farmington, New Mexico: Off target, striking a Foundation facility near Beclabito, New Mexico causing [DATA EXPUNGED] in the Navajo Nation.
Research into the recording is underway.

Note: Regardless whether Clear Water is anomalous or not, nobody would want a nuke to go off in their territory, much less a series of them. Or a very bad pun of June. - Dr. Cleveland

Test 914-0715
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 30/04/2019
Total Items: 1 5-gallon bucket of paint.

Note: Counting Doctors Clocks' and Cleveland's experiments, we are now at 18 instances of "19" in recent tests. I suspect something will happen here involving a final instance, as I felt inexplicably compelled to use a bucket of paint for this experiment. Dr. Veritas, I've left a file in your office containing an updated version of my last will and testament. If nothing comes of this, I ask that you destroy it. If, on the other hand, this goes as I feel it will…well, it's been fun, everyone. -Prof. Wren

Note: Prof. Wren forewent usage of D-class personnel for this experiment, stating that she was "ready for whatever 914 throws her way."

Input: The bucket.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A plastic urn, Grecian style, filled with white paint. Upon the output booth opening, the urn fell over, causing a series of small paint-creatures began crawling out of it en masse; the object and its behavior proved consistent with that of SCP-019. The creatures proved immensely hostile, attacking Prof. Wren on site. Hostilities were thwarted by security personnel 2 minutes later when the object and the creatures were destroyed via a full-power blast from the "H2O-9000" water gun created in a previous experiment. No further anomalous properties noted in the paint or the remains of the urn. Security personnel treated for minor injuries caused by recoil from the water gun.

Note: That…was unpleasant, to say the least, but I think you can scrap that file I left for you, boss. Whatever connection this might have to SCP-019 definitely merits examination, though…regardless, I got one last thing to do here before we get to cleaning all this paint up. -Prof. Wren

Input: The urn's remains.
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of plastic dust.

Note: Okay, I'm good now. Hopefully this puts an end to all this "19" BS. Good Lord I'm gonna need a shower and a change of clothes, though. Those little bastards got paint in places I didn't even know I had. - Prof. Wren

Note: Scrap what I said about this 19 thing seeming benign before, 914 doesn't seem to know the meaning of the word. Glad you're alright, especially in light of 914's apparently higher than usual lethality as of late. -JR. Rasclon

Note: Just to remind you, Nukea's funeral begins in an hour or two. If you're coming, you need to change fast. On the other hand, I'd hate to see another of us pass away. Looks like luck is on your side, Wren. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: Indeed. Thanks for the reminder, just got finished. On my way; bringing the amp-Stratocaster and a recording of Dr. Nukea's vocals from that song so that Darby and I can work with him one last time. -Prof. Wren

Note: Why is it that 914 researchers all seem to be suicidal? - Dr. Trandfir

Test 914-0716
Name: Dr. Hort, D-914-714
Date: 30/04/2019
Total items: 50 grams of boron, 50 grams of silicon, 50 grams of germanium, 50 grams of arsenic, 50 grams of antimony, 50 grams of tellurium.

Note: I just got assigned to 914. You guessed it, I’m a chemist. -Dr. Hort

Input: All of above
Setting: Fine
Output: A cube of 300 grams of a black material, which expelled a black toxic gas.
Further research revealed that the material was a compound of all the previous elements.

Note: How is that even possible? -Dr. Hort

Note: You are very new here. - Veritas

Input: Results from the last test
Setting: Fine
Output: A large specimen of corvus corax (common crow), apparently composed of the previous material.
When the D-class tried to retrieve it, the bird transformed into gas, escaping from D-914-714’s hands, and proceeded to float to Dr. Hort’s arm and become solid again.

Note: I think it likes me. I’ll name it Reepicheep. -Dr. Hort

Test 914-0717
Name: Dr. Peters
Date: 30/04/2019
Items: Chainmail hauberk

Note: I was going to send 17 Again through 914 in memory of Nukea, but I can't seem to find a copy of it anywhere. I found this chainmail in one of my drawers so I'm using it instead. It's the thought that counts, right? -Dr Peters

Input: 1 chainmail hauberk
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 17 steel envelopes each containing an embossed letter written in the style of "send this to so many people or…" chain letters. Notably, each number has been replaced with 17. Each letter has the memetic property where the reader believes the contents and tries to "forward" the letters to others. 1 D-class and 3 guards were affected before anmestics were administered and the letters moved to specimen storage.
Exerpts follow:
Nukeamail is running out of usernames and inactive users will be removed. Forward this to 17 people to keep…
There are 17 weekends this month. This only happens every 289 years. Forward this to 17 friends for…
FWD:FWD:FWD:NUKEA:FWD:FWD KEEP READING OR YOU WILL DIE!!@! … 17 people…. Bloody Mary will…

Note: It seems the thought really did count this time. -Dr Peters

Note: It really does. -Intern Lunar

Test 914-0718
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 30/04/2019
Total Items: 300 grams of aquamarine beryl

Input: 100 grams of aquamarine
Setting: 1:1
Output: A small cup made of aquamarine containing aquamarine powder

Input: 100 grams of aquamarine
Setting: Fine
Output: A disc made of aquamarine that will induce hallucinations in whoever comes in contact with it, causing them to percieve everything as being 'made of aquamarine'. Actual vision is unaffected, and opaque objects will not become transparent under the effect.

Note: I'm never touching that again. - Jane Cho

Input: 100 grams of aquamarine
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A perfectly formed hexagonal aquamarine rod. When one end of the rod is pressed with a human finger, a high-energy beam of infrared light will be emitted from the other end, which almost ignited the opposing wall.

Note: That was… unexpected. At least nobody got hurt. - Jane Cho

Note: Good thing Darby wasn't in charge of this test -Dr. Mensa

Test 914-0719
Name: Dr. Hort
Date: 30/04/2019
Total items: 3 glasses, 90 ml of human tears.

Input: One glass, 30 ml of human tears.
Setting: Coarse
Output: Pieces of glass, a small block of sodium and a mixture of hydrogen, chloride and oxygen gas.

Note: testing was paused for 5 minutes due to the risk of breathing chloride gas.

Input: One glass, 30 ml of human tears.
Setting: 1:1
Output: The liquid was unchanged, but the glass had the words “sea water” engraved on it’s surface.

Input: One glass, 30 ml of human tears.
Setting: Fine
Output: One glass, 30 ml of blood.
Apparently, the cells that the tears contained were changed genetically to act like blood cells.

Note: So… It’s blood without a blood type? - Dr. Hort

Note: Not exactly, the blood type is already imprinted on the DNA. What likely happened was 914 converted the cells to stem cells and then into blood cells.

Note: So I spent some time in the lab looking at a sample of this "blood" and my analyzers aren't seeing any RBCs, WBCs, or platelets, so it cant be blood. I believe 914 rearranged the lactoferrin naturally present in tears and combined them with skin cell fragments to create pseudo-RBCs leading to the red color. Or something entirely different since 914 doesn't make sense. -Dr. Peters

Note: Surely this cant end up with me hospitalized? Right? - Researcher Darby

Input: 101 Ways to Boil Eggs
Setting: Rough
Output: Ripped pile of paper.

Note: Okay, still safe, no explosions yet - Researcher Darby

Input: "Thai Food Recipes"

Output: Pile of paper and a puddle of ink.

Note: Again, nothing new or unexpected, also I'm going to put both books in to see what happens. - Researcher Darby

Input: "101 Ways to Boil Eggs" and "Thai Food Recipes"
Setting: 1:1
Output: "101 Ways to find a Curse" and "Curse breaking for Dummies".

Note: Curses? What? Where did curses come into the equation? - Researcher Darby

Input: "101 Ways to Boil Eggs" and "Thai Food Recipes"
Setting: Fine
Output: "101 Ways to boil a chicken man" and "SCP-3199, A detailed explanation"

Note: Bloody hell, That Chicken man is going to give me nightmares. Hopefully the amnestics I will have to take after reading the SCP-3199 book will nullify my reading of the chicken book. - Researcher Darby

Input: "101 Ways to Boil Eggs" and "Thai Food Recipes"
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A "Cookbook", recipes included are "Researcher Alfredo, Wren Waffles, Calloway Chops, Vodka Veritas Cocktail, Stan Steak, Lunar Cheese, Darby Dumplings, Jeff Cake, Hort-Burgers, Beiderman Brautwurst, ect." At the back of the book is a list of Discontinued Recipes such as "Anton and Anchovies, Nukea Nuclear Cocktail, and Wasabi covered Westrin". On the front and back cover is a memetic symbol that causes viewers to attempt to create the recipes included. Due to a possible similarity to [REDACTED] "Cookbook" was sent to incinerators to be destroyed but vanished mid-transit along with D-35456 who is presumed to be at large.

Note: It really gives you some perspective when you try to cook yourself. Thankfully, Medical Officer Lawrence stopped me from chopping anything important off. - Researcher Darby

Note: I found the thing in the trash bin outside of [REDACTED]'s containment chamber, and seriously 914? Matism Miso? The recipe had the broth made from my vitrious humor. I don't even have enough of that to fill a water glass! - Dr. Matism

Note: Not sure if I should be offended or happy I'm not included in those recipes. -Dr. Peters

Note: Oh you're in here alright, you're Peters Pineapple Upside Down Cake. Fortunately, it actually contains pineapple, and isn't made from your spleen - Dr. Matism

Note: Annnnd we have a death, one of the recipes is "D-Class disaster", when D-35456 found that recipe he managed to obtain a gun and blow his brains out onto a plate. -Researcher Festiv

Note: a "Mensa Martini" made out of my own plasma? I think Researcher Darby should take a break from SCP-914 -Dr. Mensa

Note: "Cleveland Chowder", made from my fingers. And then we have "Grizzly Grill", "Boston Borscht", "Thawed Thompson" etc. near the back. Is 914 planning to torture or murder everyone? Also, it's just plain luck that we only lost one D-class to it. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: Mine is a tier cake with three tiers, each requiring a heart that is "a genetic match" of mine. Looks like this is going to be a recurring theme. I'll start being a lot more cautious with my tests. -JR. Rasclon

Note: The Vodka Veritas Cocktail sounds lovely, we just need to replace my blood with a substitute. I get that 914 might have a jab at my average blood/alcohol concentration, but as with most things, I won't give it the satisfaction of getting upset about it. - Veritas

Test 914-0721
Name: N.C.E.
Date: 30/04/2019
Total items: One Sample of the tissue present in the Doctor Beiderman entity.

Note: Testing proved the entity was made out of colored wax, and animated through anomalous means. - Medical Officer Lawrence

Input: Tissue sample
Setting: Fine
Output: One wax sausage.

Note: Huh, Beiderman Brautwurst. 914's showing a correlation between this and a previous experiment - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0722
Name: Dr. Mensa
Date: 30/04/2019
Total Items: A Mucus Sample of Dr. Mensa in a large glass petri dish suspended in alcohol

Note: My first experiment here. Let's hope it's good! -Dr. Mensa

Input: Mucus Sample
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A martini glass full of a clear liquid. When given to a D-class personnel the subject immediately collapsed and was pronounced dead, however on the way to the morgue the subject regained conciseness and started impersonating Dr. Mensa. Subject was later terminated after an interview. Analysis of the drink reveals it is composed of one half Dr. Mensa's DNA and one half a substance with an impossibly high alcohol content that would immediately cause alcohol poisoning.

Note: I was hoping to clone myself but I think this is the Mensa Martini from the cookbook Darby made. I wonder what the other recipes do? -Dr. Mensa

Test 914-0723
Name: Jr. Researcher Sionur, D-1904, D-0431
Date: 30/04/2019
Total Items: 5 stainless steel rods (0.5 cm diameter, 30 cm of length).

Note: Just been assigned here, apparently multiple spots opened up. I'm gonna start with something simple, hopefully my first experiment won't result in any kind of frightening thunderbolts or lightning. -Sionur

Note: The only reason spots open up is because we're all suicidal maniacs, with the exception of Wren - Dr. Matism

Input: One of the above
Setting: Rough
Output: Multiple small fragments, at a temperature of -123°C. From the way the fragments are broken it appears the rod has been chilled, reheated, then put under high pressure on both ends.

Note: Good thing I felt that the air was cold before I touched them, would have left some skin otherwise. I'll send D-Class next time to limit risks. -Sionur

Input: One of the above
Setting: Coarse
Output: 4 rods of variable sizes , analysis identified them to be made of Nickel, Iron, Chromium and Carbon. Each rod kept the same proportions as the original.

Input: One of the above
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 steel mug on which is engraved the face of Freddy Mercury. Mug is smaller than average, likely due to material restrictions.

Note: Wait, does this thing read what I write on my report? Also can I please keep the mug? The engraving is surprisingly detailed. -Sionur

Note: You're new, so I'll explain this once: You can keep the results if they seem harmless, but remember that if that thing causes a containment breach, causes casualties or makes your favorite toe explode, it's your responsibility, not mine. - Veritas

Input: One of the above
Setting: Fine
Output: A shrapnel explosion, noise reportedly similar to a thunderstrike, D-1904 suffered broken bones and bleeding, both internal and external and was sent to medical emerency.

Note: Dodged a bullet here, I dread what comes next. -Sionur

Input: One of the above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The rod, apparently unchanged, when put in contact with anything, the rod will halt all electric circulation . When D-0431 picked it up, she promptly collapsed and died, due to necessary muscles not being activated and to the complete cessation of brain activity. Rod was successfully recovered with the use of gloves, as it seems to only apply to what directly touches it. Now placed in anomalous containment.

Note: Huh, I guess 914 took my request of not having thunderbolt or lightning quite literally… Could be handy as an emergency power breaker… -Sionur

Test 914-0724
Name: Junior Researcher Roa
Date: 30/04/2019
Total Items: Four standard Bic brand mechanical pencils

Note: I'm excited to perform my first solo test. Researcher Lombardi suggested I start with mechanical pencils as they have a variety of materials to refine and clear functions to improve. - Roa

Note: Apologies in advance for the deception - I'm actually testing a hypothesis that 914 reacts not only to the operator's state of mind, but that of any individuals nearby. I need the operator to be unaware so as to avoid subconscious influence. I have interns Humber and Lewis with me - we'll all be thinking vividly about fire during these tests. Extinguishers are nearby in case we are too successful. - Lombardi

Input: One mechanical pencil
Setting: 1:1
Output: One 'Pilot' brand mechanical pencil. The pencil's body is colored red.

Note: Bic to Pilot? I'd expect that on 'Fine'. - Roa

Input: One mechanical pencil
Setting: Fine
Output: One unbranded mechanical pencil with a transparent body. The spring is located at the tip of the pencil rather than near the eraser. Pushing in the eraser activates the pencil, causing the spring to visibly heat up. This reaction melts the loaded graphite rod, allowing it to flow and mark surfaces similar to ink. How the spring manages to heat, or how the graphite is able to melt in standard pressures is still unknown.

Input: One mechanical pencil
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One candle-shaped object. The body is made of plastic, while the wick is a composite of rubber, graphite, and metal. When lit, the candle quickly melted and spilled over the table. On examination, the melted remains had formed into what Junior Researcher Roa was thinking of writing next - this output log.

Note: I seem to be getting a pattern of heat or fire-based results. I've heard of 914 having 'themed' reactions with certain researchers. Why is it giving me fire? I don't want to be the fire guy. I will attempt to derail this by concentrating on ice. - Roa

Input: One mechanical pencil
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One intricately crafted pencil, inlaid with fine patterns of rubber and metal. The word 'Freezer Burn' is imprinted along the side. Graphite automatically extends from the tip to maintain a constant length of 2mm. Markings made with this pencil spontaneously erupt into grayish flames after approximately 15 seconds. These flames cause a super-cooling reaction with any materials they touch, but do not appear to spread beyond the initial contact point. The markings shrink as the flames burn until both disappear.

Note: The D-Class operating the pencil had to be treated for topical frost-bite. - Roa

Note: The disturbing implication here is that this could be linked to the recent rise of Staff accidents and deaths. It would only take a single bad actor daydreaming just a little too hard about a coworker they dislike. - Lombardi

Note: Don't tempt me, Lombardi. - Veritas

Test 914-0725
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 30/04/2019
Total Items: 1 ream of A4 paper, 1 inkwell

Note: No word on what compelled me to bring a bucket of paint in last time. Regardless, toning it back down a bit for this one; while we hit a 19th instance of "19" in total, 914's shown its interactions to be a bit more personal to whoever's using it. Calloway gets trolled, Darby gets damn near killed, and I get some inexplicable music/origami/19 mix, so for all I know I may have at least 2 more coming. Guess we'll see. -Prof. Wren

Input: 3 sheets of paper, 5 ounces of ink.
Setting: Fine
Output: A monochrome, photo-quality image of an adolescent girl at a party.

Note: I remember this. This was the party my family threw for my 19th birthday. Guess that makes number 18 for my own list. Hoo boy… -Prof. Wren

Input: 19 sheets of paper, 19 ounces of ink.
Setting: Very Fine

Note: You know what, may as well go for broke on this one. Suggest everyone clear out in case it decides to make a copy of another SCP again. Won't deny I'm nervous as hell, but whatever's going on with this "19" crap will, hopefully, come to an end. -Prof. Wren

Output: A single 915.37cm x 1294.59cm sheet of paper, folded into a self-interlocking shape that took Prof. Wren 22 minutes to fully unfold. Upon being fully opened, the inside was revealed to contain only a note, reading as follows: "Paranoia test concluded."

Note: What. -Prof. Wren

Note: That makes two times this 19 trend has concluded, which leans towards the idea that these trends we're seeing are based on our perception of what 914 is doing. This could to a feedback loop where it produces results related to that and fuels the idea, which is why seemingly significant events happened in both conclusions. In that case, it seems like these could end up being quite dangerous, especially if the increased lethality we're seeing is one of them. -JR. Rasclon

Note: Either that, or the previous "conclusion" was part of whatever this "paranoia test" was. I just want to know who or what was behind it. Was this 914's doing? Was something else controlling 914's outputs somehow? Either way, on the possibility that you're right, I've got no problem staying off the Very Fine setting for a good long while. -Prof. Wren

Note: Wise words, Wren.

Note: So now it's the one testing us? Great, just great. -Dr. Mensa

Test 914-0726
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 30/04/2019
Total Items: One photo of Prof. Wren, one photo of Dr. Beiderman

Input: Photo of Prof. Wren
Setting: Fine
Output: Photo of Prof. Wren and Researcher Darby singing onstage at Dr. Nukea's funeral. When shown to anyone who were present at Dr. Nukea's funeral, he or she would recall all memories shared with Dr. Nukea.

Note: That was plain unexpected. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: Really nice, though. I don't think I've had that much fun or cried that hard in my whole life. -Prof. Wren

Input: Photo of Dr. Beiderman
Setting: Fine
Output: What can only assumed to be a photo of Dr. Beiderman and D-1618 sharing a kiss in Wollongong, Australia. The photo is dated 12/05/2019.

Note: Well, I never. Send someone to Australia for some confirmation. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: Field trip? -Intern Lunar

Note: Sure. Anyone who is interested in flying to Sydney? Our missing researcher and D-class are probably located. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: I'm not paying for your road trip, I'm paying through the nose for that cleanup crew alone. Ask Norton from Accounting, and good luck trying to convince him that everything you need is absolutely required for official Foundation business, or just pay for your own Mojitos. - Veritas

Note: I'm going to Sydney this summer; maybe I should check it out. -Dr. Mensa

Test 914-0727
Name: Dr. Tanger
Date: 01/05/2019
Total Items: Three copies of Where the Sidewalk Ends by Shel Silverstein.

Note: I want to see if 914 understands simple poetry. If it does well on this test, we might move on to more advanced writing. - Dr. Tanger

Input: One item mentioned above
Setting: 1:1
Output: One copy of It's Raining Pigs and Noodles by Jack Prelutsky

Input: One item mentioned above
Setting: Fine
Output: One copy of The Foundation's Follies by Alexander Tanger, detailing the major failures of the Foundation in poetry form.

Note: Why is this machine trying to get me fired? - Dr. Tanger

Input: One item mentioned above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A plain-looking paperweight / That changes the linguistic state / Of the author to write /
Anything that they might / In a poetry form that they hate.

Note: A break is what I need now / If Veritas would ever allow / 914 has me done / So I have to run / Limerick poems are horrible - wow. - Dr. Tanger

Test 914-0728
Name: Dr. Hort
Date: 01/05/2019
Total items: 3 vials, 60 ml of krypton.

Input: 1 vial containing 20 ml of krypton.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A pile of aluminium nitrate, a pile of strontium.

Note: Even though you switched the protons, it doesn’t mean it’s equal, 914.

Input: 1 vial containing 20 ml of krypton.
Setting: Fine
Output: A cloud of a compound of silicon, oxygen and krypton.

Note: This machine just altered the laws of physics. How is this gas even stable?

Input: 1 vial containing 20 ml of krypton.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Upon opening of the output booth, a white flash of over 13,000 lumens filled the room, burning Dr. Hort’s corneas. The vial was empty and unchanged.

Note: Luckily, I will be able to recover after a cornea transplant. Also, ouch. -Dr. Hort

Note: This is why I wear sunglasses indoors Hort. -Dr. Mensa

Note: It's also why it's standard procedure to use D-Class when testing 914 - Dr. Trandfir

Test 914-0729
Name: Dr. Clocks, D-07431
Date: 01/05/2019
Total items: Five copies of Macbeth

Note: Due to the whole 'cursed' nature of the aforementioned play. I've naturally sent a D-Class in for cover, just so I don't turn into another Darby. -Dr Clocks

Input: One copy of Macbeth
Setting: Rough
Output: Lumps of leather alongside piles of shredded and burnt paper.

Input: One copy of Macbeth
Setting: Coarse
Output: One standard white paper cup filled with a reddish type of liquid. Chemical analysis shows it to be a sample of 'bad luck'.

Note: This is exactly what I was expecting with this test. Lets just hope it doesn't get any worse. -Dr Clocks

Input: One copy of Macbeth
Setting: 1:1
Output: One copy of Titus Andronicus.

Input: One copy of Macbeth
Setting: Fine
Output: One altered copy of Macbeth titled 'Clocks'. Analysis reveals it to be almost identical to the original play aside from several assets being changed and the characters being replaced with Foundation personnel. Macbeth has been replaced with Dr. Clocks, Lady Macbeth has been replaced with Prof. Wren and King Duncan has been replaced with Veritas.

Note: Weird. I get what 914 was going for, but why am I married to Wren? I'd also like to notify that the characters 'MacDonald' and 'The Thane of Cawdor' have been replaced with Researcher Darby and Dr. Nukea. Both of whom have been killed off in the play beforehand. -Dr Clocks

Input: One copy of Macbeth
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Three miniature models of what appeared to be witches made entirely out of paper and slight traces of leather. When Dr Clocks approached them, they yelled out 'Hail thee, █████ Clocks, Senior Researcher.', 'Hail thee, █████ Clocks, Site Director.' and finally 'Hail thee, █████ Clocks, Foundation Administrator here on out!' before being immediately being terminated by security personnel.

Note: No, just no. I've already had a rough day, so no. -Dr Clocks

Items: 3 spools of steel wire

Input: One spool of wire
Setting: Coarse
Output One melted pile of steel

Input: One spool of wire
Setting: 1:1
Output One cube of solid steel

Input: One spool of wire
Setting: Fine
Output One small steel sculpture of Dr. Matism with multiple blades embedded in his chest. The sculpture is titled '7/5/19'.

Note: I'm skipping work on Tuesday - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0731
Name: Dr. Mensa
Date: 01/05/2019
Total Items: 5 (Five) Copies of ‘1984’ By George Orwell

Input: One Copy of ‘1984’
Setting: Rough
Output: Shreds of paper and cardboard in a puddle of ink

Note: Perfectly normal -Dr. Mensa

Input: One Copy of ‘1984’
Setting: Coarse
Output: A sheet of cardboard, a stack of paper and a puddle of ink.

Note: Again this is the usual reaction -Dr. Mensa

Input: One Copy of ‘1984’
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Copy of ‘Fahrenheit 451’ By Ray Bradbury

Note: I expected ‘Animal Farm’ but this makes sense too -Dr. Mensa

Input: One Copy of ‘1984’
Setting: Fine
Output: One Copy of ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’ By Harper Lee

Note: How did 914 know that was my favorite book? -Dr. Mensa

Input: One Copy of ‘1984’
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An unmarked book that when read shows the individual reading it their ideal story. Book has been placed in the break room.

Note: For me, it was just an adaptation of ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ although I’m Interested in what others read. -Dr. Mensa

Note: Mine was simple, "Once upon a time there was life, then it died. The end." Makes sense due to my nihilistic view of the world - Dr. Matism

Note: I got a reality anchor repair manual. I really like my job. - MT Johnson

Test 914-0732
Name: Dr. Matism
Date: 01/05/2019
Items: One globe

Input: The Globe
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One levitating model of Earth. The model has an anomalous inner core made of the iron from the globe's bearings that creates a small magnetic field capable of sustaining a small gaseous atmosphere. Small colonies of normally airborne bacteria are placed in heavily foliaged areas. All bodies of water normally present on Earth are also visible.

Note: A small, self-sustaining biosphere with its own independently functioning ecosystems. I'll keep this in my office. Just so you know Dr. Veritas, I've placed a small incendiary charge next to it just in case it starts acting up - Dr. Matism

Note: It appears the organisms on the globe are beginning to evolve, and we now have a miniature version of SCP-3000. In addition, small land-based mammals are beginning to show up as well. I fear the day they start a space program - Dr. Matism

Note: I dropped a paperclip into the Pacific and I might have caused a mass extinction -Dr. Mensa

Note: Fortunately, due to the laws of time, the inhabitants have relatively accelerated evolution, and have evolved to the point where they know how to build blast shelters. You did, though obliterate the entirety of the west coast of the Americas and the east coast of Asia. Congratulations Mensa, you caused a lesser VK-Class scenario on your second day. - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0733
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 01/05/2019
Items: 5 CDs of various Metallica albums.

Note: Please be done with the 19 nonsense. -Prof. Wren

Input: Metallica album, "Ride the Lightning."
Setting: 1:1
Output: A miniature bicycle. Touching the bicycle causes an electrostatic shock, regardless of location.

Note: I got so preoccupied triple-checking this thing for "19" references I didn't even realize the pun. -Prof. Wren

Input: Metallica album, "St. Anger."
Setting: 1:1
Output: A model of a "poo" emoji made of plastic.

Note: Critic. -Prof. Wren

Input: Metallica album, "Reload."
Setting: 1:1
Output: Album by a band called "DOS", titled "Abort, Retry, Fail?". Disc inside reshaped to a 5.25 floppy disk; no data found on it by any means.

Note: Well that was… odd. -Prof. Wren

Input: Metallica and San Fransisco Symphony album, "S&M."
Setting: 1:1
Output: A CD containing a PDF copy of the Kama Sutra in 17 languages.

Note: …Huh. Was expecting something a bit less tasteful. Anyway, saved the best one for last. -Prof. Wren

Input: Metallica album, "Black."
Setting: 1:1
Output: Acillatem album, "White." Songs on new album are the same as the input, only played in reverse and performed by female artists.

Note: Aaaand that's that, I guess. Wow, never thought I'd appreciate an uneventful day here this much. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0734
Name: Dr. Harvey the ll
Date: 01/05/2019
Total items: A machine labeled the Darby Regeneration Center

Note: I found this in Dr. Thompson’s room. She was entrusted by Veritas to make sure Terren doesn’t take it along with Darby. She allowed me to test with it because I wasn’t going to risk Darby’s life. -Harvey the ll

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: 1:1
Output: A machine labeled the Nukea Recovery Center. Around 5 seconds later, Nukea came out of the Nukea Recovery Center alive.

Note: He is alive! I missed him so much! Thank you Dr. Harvey the ll! -Tamsen.

Note: Before anyone asks, no, you cannot get any money you lost betting over Nukea's death back. - Junior Researcher Stan

Note: I'm getting security, that is not Nukea, I don't know what it is. - Researcher Darby

Note: Nukea is dead. That… thing, that abomination, it looked like one of those mutts from the Hunger Games trilogy. Have that thing terminated for Veritas' sake. Tamsen, it's trying to persuade you into believing it's Nukea. It is not. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: Further examination reveals that on the back of the Nukea Recovery Center, it details about a paranoia and delusional side effect from nearby researchers. I started to see it too but later realized that it will stop around 12 hours after Nukea has been produced. -Vand

Note: Just to be safe I had "Nukea" placed in a humanoid holding cell with food and water untill we know if it's really him or something else. -Researcher Festiv

Test 914-0735
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 01/05/2019
Items: One pair of prescription glasses.

Note: As much as I'd love to claim that I'm trying to develop a countermeasure or safety against optical memetics like that thing trying to pass itself off as Dr. Nukea, the simple truth is I lost a bet with the acting Security Chief. Lucky for me the optometrist was having a BOGO sale that weekend, so I got away with sacrificing my spares for this. -Prof. Wren

Input: The glasses.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Same pair of glasses, initially appearing unaltered except for the frames and lenses being lightly tinted blue. Further testing revealed that, by rubbing a finger along the top of the frames, a variety of visual modes could be accessed, including infrared vision, a "life-force vision" that showed an "aura" around living creatures, and over 200 modes that serve no useful purpose, including what Prof. Wren described as "Bacon-vision" which functions similar to the "life-force" vision but showed the aura around pieces of bacon instead. Tapping the sides of the frames returned the visual mode to normal.

Note: …Okay, now I know 914's just screwing with me, but you know what? I'll take it. Switching view modes is gonna take some practice, though; I slide my finger a freaking millimeter and it rotates through about 60 different modes fast enough to make me want to vomit. Definitely touchy, this one. -Prof. Wren

Note: Upon discovering that one of the visual modes blocked the effects of optical memetics and cognitohazards, security forces confiscated the glasses to ensure they were not misused.

Note: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]. -Prof. Wren

Note: Does anyone know if this thing could block the effects of infohazards like The Eleventh Hour (the result from 914 the first time I used it) nullified 1128's? - Dr. Cleveland

Note: I'm willing to bet that's classified above our pay levels now. I was just getting to like those, too. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0736
Name: JR. Rasclon
Date: 02/05/2019
Items: Four 10g chunks of natural uranium, each consisting of 99.3% uranium-238 and 0.7% uranium-235 by mass.

Note: After some painkillers and therapy, I've managed to get over my previous test. I want to test if common refinement processes can be carried out by 914, as well as see if the easier to predict Rough and Coarse settings can be semi-reliably used to, say, enrich uranium by splitting the isotopes into discrete chunks. I've got the proper clearance to do this, as well as the necessary safety equipment. I'll also be avoiding Rough, to hopefully prevent any particulate uranium from being created or inhaled, and will terminate the test before Very Fine if things start to get particularly dangerous. -JR. Rasclon

Input: Chunk of uranium
Setting: Coarse
Output: Three 3.33g chunks of uranium, each retaining the original ratio of isotopes.

Note: Not the 238/235 split I was hoping for. Also, three identical chunks. So far, nothing dangerous though. -JR. Rasclon

Input: Chunk of uranium
Setting: 1:1
Output: One 10g chunk of uranium, in a different shape to the input.

Note: Both of these first two outputs were disposed of with standard radioisotope handling equipment.

Input: Chunk of uranium
Setting: Fine
Output: A 10g chunk of uranium with a fluctuating ratio of isotopes. The chunk of uranium possesses the anomalous property of constantly shifting the position of the uranium-235 inside it. This has been observed to work even when the chunk was separated into multiple discrete pieces, with the uranium-235 apparently moving between the pieces.

Note: Weird, but ultimately no more harmful than normal uranium. The Very Fine test will be going ahead, but the test will be conducted by D-5396 while the testing chamber is observed remotely. -JR. Rasclon

Input: Chunk of uranium
Setting: Fine
Output: A chunk of uranium, which was glowing brightly enough to blind D-5396. The glow dimmed considerably in the next two hours, and researchers entering the chamber found that the uranium was emitting electromagnetic radiation near-equally across the electromagnetic spectrum between the wavelengths of 1cm and 1nm. This emission reduced the half-life of the uranium to only 20 minutes, causing it to glow intensely and decay rapidly. D-5396 is being treated for radiation poisoning. The short half-life of the material caused it to decay into non-anomalous isotopes quickly enough to be stored in the same manner as non-anomalous radioisotopes.

Note: Well, I didn't get the result I wanted, but there are a few things to be gained from this. For one, the fact that 914 can anomalously affect and accelerate transmutation effects like atomic decay, despite not being able to cause it directly. As an aside, the half-life was a third of an hour. However, no escalation is yet present in the "three" trend, thankfully. -JR. Rasclon

Test 914-0737
Name: Researcher A. Dross
Date: 05/05/2019
Total items: One VR headset, several high quality tablets, and a graph paper drawing of a 'protogen'.

Input: Aforementioned items.
Setting: Very fine
Output: A black triangle A black, somewhat triangular object that attached itself to R. Dross after an attempt to remove it from the output booth. The object promptly turned on, displaying what appeared to be the eyes, mouth, and nostrils of the protogen.
No adverse effects observed during and after attachment.

Note: Despite efforts by medical personnel to get the visor off, it cannot be removed. Further attempts are discouraged, due to it now being R. Dross's face.

Note: Researcher A. Dross retains the ability to breathe, eat, and see through anomalous means. Additionally, emotions such as anger and sadness display emoticons on the visor.

Test 914-0738
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 07/05/2019
Total Items: 0.7kg pallasite meteorite sample

Input: Meteorite sample
Setting: Fine
Output: A long metal pole composed of the iron-nickel alloy, topped with a large faceted peridot crystal. Polishing revealed that the Widmanstätten patterns were still present in the metal.

Test 914-0739
Name: Dr. Hort
Date: 07/05/2019
Total Items: Vegetable burrito

Note: This test was made to see if 914 can transform certain types of energy into others. Music was played at 120 decibels inside the input chamber before starting 914, with the objective of cooking the burrito using the kinetic sound energy.

Input: Burrito
Setting: Fine

Test 914-0740
Name: Researcher Darby
Date: 07/05/2019
Total Items: Six Boeing 737 jet engines

Note: I obtained military grade blast shields, so hopefully if things go wrong, I will not get hurt - Researcher Darby

Input: One Boeing 737 engine.
Setting: Rough
Output: One mangled and scorched Boeing 737 engine.

Input: One Boeing 737 engine
Setting: Coarse
Output: Several piles of engine components and a bucket of fuel

Note: Did I forget to flush the fuel from the engines? Well, it's too late at this point anyway. - Researcher Darby

Input: One Boeing 737 engine
Setting: 1:1
Output: Two Rolls Royce engines.

Input: One Boeing 737 engine
Setting: 1:1
Output: One liquid fuel booster (bell nozzle).

Input: One Boeing 737 engine
Setting: Fine
Output: One Steel mannequin dressed in heavy plate armor reminiscent of medieval German armors. Mannequin is armed with several blades arrayed around its body and is posed as if to ambush whoever enters the booth.

Note: Thankfully, it is not animate, I don't think there's enough Security Personnel to contain it if it was. I do like that it is completely anatomically correct, it even has fuel for blood. - Researcher Darby

Input: One Boeing 737 engine
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Seven miniature jet fighters that upon SCP-914's output door opening, flew out and attacked Researcher Darby to no effect due to crashing into Researcher Darby's blast shield. Inside the output booth, 13 more planes were found. They seemed inoperable until Researcher Darby attempted to collect them, upon which they self-destructed, fracturing several bones of both Darby and surrounding security personnel.

Note: I think maybe I'll try something simpler next time, like a teddy bear, or a log. That can't possibly hurt me right? - Researcher Darby

Note: The log (if wood) would probably explode giving everyone splinters, and the bear probably would find some magical way to hurt someone. Why not try a mug? It couldn't be that bad, right? -Intern Lunar

Note: What about a plastic bottle full of oxygen? Surely that couldn’t harm Darby if it was refined… right? -Dr. Clockworks

Note: Darby got really lucky this time. Normally such an outcome would result in at least one death. - Dr. Cleveland

Note: I'm glad that you are taking more precautions towards your safety, Darby. This should be an example for everyone and will definitely help with lowering the amount of pain killers I've been prescribing to this research unit. -Doctor Starr.

Note: Darby, maybe a battery next test. It might make something compatible with this stupid thing on my face. - Researcher A. Dross.

Note: Oh. Darby's back. Fantastic. - Veritas

Total Items: Four pills of "914 Brand Painkiller" from previous testing, 1 handwritten note, 1 pencil.

Note: Seeing the success of my previous test, I’ve come to the conclusion that further enhancement of our own medicines are due. I’ve put in my request to be moved from my current position as Nurse for SCP-914 victims a Physician in the Medical Ward to a Researcher. I’ve already received a promotion from level 1 to level 2 clearance for my success with the painkillers. -Doctor Starr.

Input: One of the above mentioned pills
Setting: Coarse
Output: An almost invisible white gas cloud that was dissipated into the room. Scans show that it originated from the top output booth and it has the same chemical makeup as “914 Brand Painkillers”. Scans conducted after D-Class reported numbness in airway and skin.

Input: One of the above mentioned pills
Setting: 1:1
Output: Unchanged Pill One pill of “914 Brand Pain”. Discovery found out after D-Class ingestion. D-Class was administered on-hand ‘’914 Brand Painkiller” listed in total items.

Note: I was planning on doing two tests on Fine, but I could not watch a “914 Brand Pain” in action again. I may not want to be a doctor anymore but I still refuse to intentionally hurt someone like that. Moving on to the reason I’m here. -Doctor Starr.

Input: One of the above mentioned pills, one note asking, “Can you alter this so they sedate people as well, please?”, one pencil
Setting: Fine
Output: New note in the form of an SCP-914-E log that isn't found anywhere in the records. It alone has the same mass as all of the items put in the input. Much of the log is blocked out using a mixture of the pencil (minus the graphite) and “914 Brand Painkiller” fused with the paper. It states the following:

[End Transcript]

Note: This is both intriguing and potentially promising. We are talking about mass production of an SCP-500 class drug. I’ve check all the previous logs and all storage lockers 270-279 and haven’t found anything in regards to this experiment. While a good portion of the log is blocked out, it seems we might be able to follow it and create what is known as a miracle cure, which is, as stated by myself in the log, the holy grail of modern medicine. It says that I received clearance for this test, so I am asking now if I may be allowed to conduct this experiment. -Doctor Starr.

Note: Starr, you're extremely new here if you trust anything that machine is saying. I'd be fine with it if you just endangered yourself, call it natural selection, but I'm not touching this with a ten meter pole until Hackett gives the OK because you're going to endanger those around you and I won't be held responsible. - Veritas

Input: 1 shirt.
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 souvenir T-shirt, XL size, from the San Diego Zoo.

Note: Wow, I have not Knott not been there in years! I should go back time. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 shirt.
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 souvenir T-shirt, XL size, from the Broadway musical "Cats."

Note: Hmm. Not Knott Not really a fan of this one. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 shirt.
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 plain white T-shirt, XL size, with an unusual symbol on it. Symbol does Knott contain any anomalous properties. a memetic symbol on it. Viewing the symbol causes the viewer to briefly feel compelled to spell all homonyms of "not" as "Knott."

Note: Had to go back and re-correct the written copy of my notes up until this point after seeing that. Stupid thing convinced me I was somehow misspelling "not" over and over. Good grief that was embarrassing. Knott funny, 914. Pun fully intended. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0747
Name: Junior Researcher Darian, Observed by Dr.Sheath
Date: 09/05/2019
Total Items: 4 Non-rechargeable AA Duracell Batteries (No charge)

Note: I’ll be skipping Rough due to fears of a detonated battery, and all of them will have their charge depleted in order to reduce risk of something unsavory happening. -Junior Researcher Darian

Input: 1 Duracell Battery (No charge)
Setting: Coarse
Output: Multiple minute blocks of steel, and other metals.

Input: 1 Duracell Battery (No charge)
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 Energizer AA battery

Input: 1 Duracell Battery (No charge)
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 AA battery of unknown manufacturer. It can hold half as much power in it, but can handle higher voltages.

Note: I was expecting something like a rechargeable battery, but then again this is 914 after all.

Input: 1 Duracell Battery (No charge)
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Unchanged

Note: From reading many of the previous logs, something is up. Additional safety measures have been taken. -Darian

A D-class was sent in with protective clothing to retrieve the battery. The D-class picked up the battery with tongs, but dropped it while transporting it to a non-conductive container for study. The battery forcefully shattered, tearing through the protective suit the D-class was wearing and inflicting multiple cuts.

Afterword: Seems like 914 changed the battery from storing electrical energy to kinetic energy, and charged it somehow. -Darian

Test 914-0748
Note: Now that I have clearance, I will be carrying out the experiment written out by SCP-914 on 08/05/2019. We are hoping to create the perfect cure. -Doctor Starr

Name: Doctor Starr
Date: 09/05/2019
Total Items: One pill of "914 Brand Painkiller" from previous testing, 100 grams of pure hydrogen, 100 grams of pure carbon, canister containing 100 grams of pure nitrogen, and one containing 100 grams of pure oxygen.

Input: All of the items stated above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Slightly larger pill in tablet form but the top now states “914 Brand Miracle Acid”. Two ruptured aluminium canisters. Underside of tablet has the words “Cures all worries and allows consumers to see violent penguins successfully learn to fly.” After lab analysis of the output, it became clear that 914 combined the oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen into pure LSD and then made a new hallucinogen and depressant drug that has a previously thought impossible chemical reaction using the "914 Brand Painkiller". Log placed into storage locker 273 in Site-19 non-anomalous storage. While reverse engineering is possible, there is no reason to make more.

Note: I can’t believe it. I got duped by a machine that, for all we know, isn’t sentient. Sorry for wasting everyone's time on this one, I really thought that we could make a cure to everything in existence. -Doctor Starr

Test 914-0749
Name: Researcher A. Dross
Date: 09/05/2019
Total items: One VR headset, several high quality tablets, mass of wires, D-43098, and another drawing of a 'protogen', various electronic supplies.

Note: I had the D-Class operate the machine, because different people get different results from the same materials. -Researcher A. Dross

Input: Aforementioned items.
Setting: Very fine (performed by D-Class)
Output: Random shapes with no correlation to input Modifications for R. Dross's visor. Modifications materials consisted of a compound created by combining certain input materials, including a paper and graphite pulp.

Note: On second thought, it's best if I don't test on D-Class this time. I volunteer myself for testing. -Dross

Note: Your funeral, Dross. Or worse. - Veritas

Note: Think about it though. Giving this to D-class with the risk of them becoming too powerful to be stopped isn't something anyone would want. -Researcher A. Dross

Input: One of the outputs, specifically a thin disc shaped modification, with some of the electronic components.
Setting: Very fine
Output Another disc, with an engraving of the symbols 4NU-B15 on the side. Testing by Researcher Dross on himself that the disc allowed the visor to highlight potential threats, including an 'anti memetic hazard' mode.

Date: 09/05/2019
Total items: One photograph of SCP-882 suspended in fluid, one pencil, one paper.

Input: Aforementioned items.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One photo of O5-1, appears to have been taken through a firearm scope. One piece of paper, with the message "checkmate" written in bold lettering. One pencil. Site-1 has been put on lockdown until it is determined whether or not the photo is fabricated.

Note: Turns out, it is. Hackett tells me that O5-1 never visited Acapulco, like in the photo. Don't ask me how the geometry department figured that one out from one image, I don't know. - Veritas

Test 914-0751
Name: G (Presumed)
Date: 25/02/3099 (Speculation)
Total Items: UNKNOWN

Input: UNKNOWN ITEMS
Setting: Very Fine (Speculation)
Output: A 6 cm tall robot that danced in place for 45 seconds before ceasing function. Of note is that a speaker on the robot played a voice clip saying 'Eureka! It worked!' over itself before falling apart. The inside was made up of clockwork pieces, as well as a note written as follows:

Hello, from February 25th, 3099!! Surprised to see we're still kicking this far out? If you'd like to do the same, i.e, live, I'd request a transfer to another site. - G

Event was responded to with immediate aggression from posted guards and personnel. The event was witnessed and recorded from outside of the room, being out of use at the time.

Note: The above test occurred spontaneously. The Time and Mechanism wings of the facility have come to the conclusion that the item appears to be the result of some future version of the facility. If they are to be believed, I'd like to be transferred to Site 607-23. -Junior Researcher Aniyah

Note: This heavily implies that this test was premeditated. If this is to be the case, I request that we gather all the materials of the object and put it into a time capsule of some sort. I doubt we will need the note, so keep it on standby for testing. - Dr. Ira

Note: Both requests approved. - Site Director Hackett

Note: Oh, that's just [REDACTED] perfect. Just when we get a semi-clue of the logic in this thing, it's implied that personnel from the future starts screwing with it. - Veritas

Note: No one said that it would be easy, Lucius. - Site Director Hackett

Test 914-0752
Name: Dr. Amare
Date: 09/05/2019
Total Items: 1 standard non-scented candle

Input: Above item
Setting: Fine
Output: No physical changes, but when lit; the scent has been described as a pasta type smell.

Note: Further testing has found that each time the candle is lit, a different type of food smell is emitted. -Amare

Test 914-0753
Name: Dr. Mensa
Date: 09/05/2019
Total Items: 3 crystal wine glasses

Note: These were expensive, this better be good. -Dr. Mensa

Input: 1 Wine Glass
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 crystal pint glass

Note: the “pint” glass is considerably smaller than a regular pint glass -Dr. Mensa

Input: 1 Wine Glass
Setting: Fine
Output: A crystal statuette of a sobbing boy.

Note: Despite the terrible pun (whining), the statuette itself is quite exquisite. Permission to keep it in my office? -Dr. Mensa

Note: Granted. You have a weird taste in decoration, Mensa. - Veritas

Input: 1 Wine Glass
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Unchanged. When D-23546 went to retrieve the glass, she immediately started acting like she was intoxicated. Proceeded to attempt seducing Dr. Mensa, who was visibly uncomfortable. Upon guards attempting to retrieve D-23546 she became very agitated and attempted to attack a guard, after which she was terminated. Output was later moved to anomalous item storage.

Test 914-0754
Name: Dr. Ira
Date: 09/05/2019
Total Items: One pint of highly contaminated water

Input: Aforementioned items.
Setting: Fine
Output: One balloon like instance resembling a Tardigrade As the amount of matter inside the water, in addition to the water itself, is minimal, the instance floated and was nearly entirely translucent.

Note: It wouldd appear that all of the tissue making this thing up is extremely loosely samples of bacteria in the initial pint of water, in addition to small water molecule chains holding it together. Apologies for the rule bending here, I'd honestly completely forgotten about microscopic beings in context of this thing. -Dr. Ira

Test 914-0755
Name: Researcher A. Dross
Date: 09/05/2019

Note: As I said for years, keep it, but I'm not responsible if that thing sucks your brain out later down the line. - Veritas

Input: AI core, 1 module.
Setting: Fine.
Output: A second trapedoidal modification, with an AI assistant, referred to as Cayde. Researcher Dross became visibly upset after talking with the AI.

Note: I still miss him. -Researcher Dross

Input: Remaining objects
Setting: Very fine

Note: Security personnel were sent to provide backup in case of escalation.

Output: A dark gray jacket, made of a soft cloth thought to be woven from the carbon and iron in the steel. Small square panel on the back of the jacket with an unknown purpose.

Note: Since none of the things I make should be tested with D-Class, I will be wearing this. -R Dross.

Note: After putting the jacket on, the panel opened 6 small hatches, revealing wires that hooked into the visor. After linking, the back of the panel opened, revealing modification slots and directions in Eliksni on how to operate the panel and visor. Translation pending.

Input: Shale
Setting: Fine
Output: A stack of 256 rectangular stone tablets composed of various silicate minerals. Each sheet depicts a memetic image via arrangement of mineral crystals. Viewing said image will project a certain idea into the viewer's mind. Examples include: "Apple", "Fluorescent Lightbulb", "Crosswalk", and "Motorcycle". The sheets are completely safe to view. An ordered list of the ideas is available on request.

Note: Are these some kind of flashcards? Other than that, I haven't found any apparent pattern or meaning in the ordering of the cards. - Jane Cho

Input: Limestone
Setting: Fine
Output: A large ovaloid rock resembling the shape of a lime fruit. Mineral composition is unchanged.

Input: Chert
Setting: Fine

Input: Laterite
Setting: Fine
Output: A large, dark-colored mug containing a small faceted ruby inside. Upon inspection, the ruby has been shown to be a single crystal that has been grown while being limited in size to the 'faceted' shape.

Note: I get the ruby, but why did 914 choose to put it in a mug? - Jane Cho

Note: Could I have the mug? It's for testing. -Intern Lunar

Note: Sure. - Jane Cho

Input: Anthracite coal
Setting: Fine
Output: An extremely detailed coal sculpture of a tree log.

Test 914-0757
Name: Jr. Researcher Kramer
Date: 10/05/2019
Total Items: One metal mesh wastebin full of discarded papers from my office.

Note: This test is to see what SCP-914 would do with something that is deemed worthless.

Input: Aforementioned wastebin
Setting: Fine
Output: All the papers in the wastebin were replaced with images of Jr. Researcher Kramer with the word "Trash" stamped over them in red ink

Note: Harsh. - Jr. Researcher Kramer

Test 914-0758
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 10/05/2019
Total Items: One metal statue of Kim Jong-Il, 1:2 scale (63 percent osmium, 20 percent iridium, 10 percent cobalt, 5 percent iron, 2 percent copper).

Input: Statue
Setting: Fine
Output: One model of the Ryugong Hotel, 1:400 scale. Despite the choice of materials making up the original statue, the model neither showed mind-affecting properties consistent with telekill nor the subjective conciousness-suppressing properties of SCP-1427, instead playing all songs associated with Canadian hip hop artist Drake.

Note: Given 914's usual course of action, a symbol of oppression made of a telekill-like alloy, playing Hotline Bling of all songs is totally unexpected… All I'm sure is that I'm not doing that again. - Dr. Cleveland

Test 914-0759
Name: Researcher A. Dross
Date: 10/05/2019
Total items Sample of filament fur growing around R. Dross's visor. Sample contains no organic material.

Test 914-0760
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 10/05/2019
Items: 3 wristwatch communicator toys from the "Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers" franchise.

Input: A wrist-communicator toy.
Setting: 1:1
Output: At first glance, the same wrist-comm, but with a flip-up face that reveals a watch underneath. The numbers on the face are placed in reverse order and the hands run counterclockwise, but otherwise the watch functions normally.

Note: Technically still an accurate timepiece, but trying to read it gives me a headache. -Prof. Wren

Input: A wrist-comm.
Setting: Fine
Output: The same wrist-comm. The interior of it has been altered to function as a short-range radio that broadcasts and receives on a frequency of ████ Hz and has a maximum range of 17 kilometers. Increased functionality causes the battery life to run down significantly faster.

Note: I'm gonna get this thing tweaked to work on Foundation frequencies and replace the battery with a better power supply so that it can actually be used. After that, I call dibs, though I'm sure we can reverse-engineer a few more for anyone else. -Prof. Wren

Input:: A wrist-comm.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The same wrist-comm. Upon putting it on to test communications functions, the D-class disappeared in a beam of orange light that shot off towards the western United States. Satellite tracked it for 27 minutes until it reached the Brandeis-Bardin Campus at the American Jewish University in Sim Valley, California, where the D-class rematerialized and impacted the roof. D-class terminated.

Note: I was baffled by this until I looked at satellite photos of the place he wound up. That building was apparently used as the Command Center in the original Power Rangers. Sorry about the roof, guys. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0761
Name: Researcher A. Dross
Date: 10/05/2019
Total items: 10 unusable modifications in varying shapes and sizes.

Note: Might as well improve them, or scrap them. -Researcher Dross.

Input: 2 defunct modules
Setting: Rough
Output: Pile of scrap metal. Inspection revealed that they were destroyed by incineration.

Input: 2 defunct modules
Setting: Coarse
Output: Dissected piles of metal, wires, and unknown technological components.

Input: 2 defunct modules
Setting: 1:1
Output: One module fitting a slot in R. Dross's jacket panel. Testing revealed that the module keeps track of Jeff, the mug cat, Olive, the peridot cat, and Reepicheep, the metaloid crow, as well as Henry.

Input: 2 defunct modules
Setting: Fine
Output: One cylinder-shaped module that exploded upon being touched by D-Class. Minor blast injuries to D-45903, other personnel unharmed.

Input: 2 defunct modules
Setting: Very fine
Output: Cylindrical module with warning symbols on it. When placed in the back panel, temporary invisibility was possible. Module placed in secure storage.

Note: Darn. -R Dross.

Note: Yeah, I wouldn't actually use those if I were you. I know 914 and you're probably risking becoming permanently intangible or some other ghastly side-effect when left on too long or used too much. ''Very fine'' is extremely effective and extremely dangerous. - Veritas

Items: One large chunk of honeycomb

Note: 1. I lost a bet to Stan. 2. It's purged of all honey. 3. I have a beekeeper suit on. As well as body armor. -Researcher Festiv

Input: Chunk of honeycomb
Setting: Fine
Output: One ball of wax and fiber, which exploded into a swarm of animate wax bees upon the opening of the output chamber. The bees proceeded to attack Junior Researcher Stan, who was waiting to conduct a test at the time. Upon reaching him, the swarm melted around his wrist, before taking the shape of a wax bracelet. The bracelet stung him several times before becoming inert.

Note: It seems the bracelet stingers were made of diamond, likely made out of carbon impurities in the honeycomb. Also, what about that other bet we made Stan? You know, the one about what was going to happen with the output to this test. -Researcher Festiv

Note: Both Festiv and Stan are cleaning dishes and have cleanup duty for a week or two. They were treating my testing area like a bloody betting range rather than a professional testing environment. That wax got bloody everywhere, and my janitors have filed their third request for an increased salary, probably because they have to work with all you walking disasters. - Veritas

Output: Same as input, but with an anomalous effect that causes vegetation to grow on whatever surface it is touching, as well as speeding the growth of any vegetation it touches. The card has been placed in a locked box and is in Low-Level Anomalous Item containment.

Note: Perhaps we could use it to speed growth of 143? - Researcher Carter W.

Note: Sure Carter, there's no possible way that that can go catastrophically wrong. It stays in Anomalous Item storage. - Veritas

Test 914-0768
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 12/05/2019
Total Items: 3 globes.

Note: Given how my mom means the world to me, I thought this would be an appropriate test to run on Mother's Day. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 globe.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A scale model of the planet Jupiter, same size as the input.

Input: 1 globe.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A globe model of an initially unidentified planet. Analysis showed it to be a model of Earth with the North and South Poles, as well as the heights above/below sea level of most of the planet, inverted; for example, the Himalayas are the deepest part of the planet's oceans, while the Mariana Trench is now a towering mountain range.

Note: I did a little more research on this, and a hunch I had checked out. Apparently the elevations on this "Htrae" invert at a point nearly 1080 meters below sea level, which would be right about the halfway point between the bottom of the Challenger Deep and the peak of Mt. Everest. Kinda neat, really. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 globe.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A plastic/metal bust of Gary Oldman in his titular role from the 1992 movie "Dracula."

Note: Oh good lord… did 914 just make a Smashing Pumpkins reference? -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0769
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 12/05/2019
Total Items: 0.1kg arkose sandstone, 0.1kg shale, 0.1kg limestone, 0.1kg chert, 0.1kg laterite, 0.1kg anthracite coal

Note: I'm putting the same things in again, but this time on Very Fine. I’m only putting in one tenth of what I put in last time because it might get dangerous. Also, I’m having D-99823 take care of the output, just in case. - Jane Cho

Input: Arkose sandstone
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A roughly octahedral mass of arkose sandstone that is capable of vocalization. The sandstone proceeded to engage in a conversation (recorded below) with D-99823 before being taken out of the output booth by security personnel.

[BEGIN LOG]
Sandstone: Hello!
D-99823: Aah!
Sandstone: I’m Sandy!
D-99823: Oh. (To security guards) It’s a talking rock. I think it’s safe.
Sandstone: I come from the planet of SAND!
D-99823: Uh… Actually, you were made by this clockwork machine.
Sandstone: I’m Sandy!
D-99823: Huh?
Sandstone: I come from the planet of SAND!
D-99823 pauses for a few seconds, and then proceeds to take the object out of the output booth.
Sandstone: (At 110 decibels) SAND!
D-99823 became stunned by this and was unable to take the object out of the output booth. Security staff was able to remove the object successfully via use of earplugs. Object currently in storage.
[END LOG]

Note: Apparently, the 4 phrases it vocalized during the incident are the only things it can say. Object presumed to be not sentient. - Jane Cho

Input: Shale
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A rectangular object with a small circular cavity on one side and a similar sized circular protrusion on its top. Touching the circular protrusion causes light to be emitted from the cavity. When projected onto a canvas, it shows real-time footage of shale being formed.

Input: Limestone
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The same limestone, however with the words “SUPER LIMESTONE” engraved onto it. All subjects viewing it will be persuaded that it is superior to all other limestone, and will praise it for being high-quality.

Input: Chert
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A levitating toroid made of silica. When in the vicinity of a rock composed of >90% silica, the object will emit a beam of light and attempt to destroy it. All attempts are unsuccessful.

Note: Thank goodness I wasn't in there when it came out of the output booth. That thing shot at my phone while being carried away because of the amethyst bunny keychain. - Jane Cho

Input: Laterite
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small ruby on a dark red pedestal. Upon being removed from the pedestal, the ruby emitted a bright flash of light, and caused all personnel on-site to compliment Intern Lunar whenever they were in his vicinity. This effect lasted for 5 hours.

Note: I have a feeling that I’ve seen this one before. Also, I duct-taped the ruby to the pedestal and put it in a box so it doesn’t activate again. - Jane Cho

Note: Those that gave me gifts can take them back now if you want. I don't think I should have a Level 3 access card. -Intern Lunar

Input: Anthracite coal
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Very fine coal powder

Note: Wait, what? - Jane Cho

Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 13/05/2019
Total Items: One copy of Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie

Input: Ancillary Justice
Setting: Very Fine
Output: What appears to be a novel of the name Broken Masquerade by a Helmut Kumnick, detailing a fictionalized version of a world where the SCP Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition, the Serpent's Hand, and the Chaos Insurgency collapsed in the mid-2030s due to war. The protagonist, a jaded Colonel in the United States Army, was part of the Truth Seeker Union, seeking to reveal the circumstances which led to the destruction of Astrakhan, Usinsk, Lublin, Lansing, Bowling Green, and Plainfield on [REDACTED]. Notable appearances include SCP-053, SCP-682 (both living in an isolated part of Saskatchewan), SCP-2599 (seeking asylum in Strasbourg, France) SCP-2733 (which the protagonist used to summon his dead sister to assist him on his truth finding path), and both SCP-1173 and SCP-4036 (the latter of which, as the Adytite Republic of Polynesia, has become the 201th United Nations member, after Kosovo, New Caledonia, Scotland, Palestine, Artsakh, and Northern Cyprus). The book showed no anomalous properties other than its cover, which occasionally animates.

Note: I think I heard of this name in a very different context, in the obscure circle of "Natural Body Magic". I can't say if that's coincidence, given that this Helmut is also from Germany. On the other hand, I will have it in the Break Room for now. - Dr. Cleveland

Test 914-0771
Name: Dr. Ravensworth
Date: 13/05/2019
Total Items: 5 gummy bears

Input: 1 gummy bear
Setting: Rough
Output: Several melted puddles of gelatin.

Input: 1 gummy bear
Setting: Coarse
Output: A gummy bear cut up into multiple pieces.

Input: 1 gummy bear
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 gummy worm, with the same mass as the original bear.

Note: These next two results I will be sending in a D-class to retrieve, in case 914 tries to poison me. - Dr. Ravensworth

Input: 1 gummy bear
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 seemingly normal gummy bear. Contains a substance that induces severe vomiting and diarrhea in whoever eats it.

Input: 1 gummy bear
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An animate gummy bear that, as soon as the door was opened, jumped into the mouth of the D-class. The bear was not poisonous, and the D-class remarked that it was the best candy he had ever tasted. He also reportedly smelled like cherry for the next four hours.

Note: Huh. I guess not everything from 914 is bad after all. - Dr. Ravensworth

Test 914-0772
Name: Assistant Researcher Jack Dickie, D-51215
Date: 14/05/2019
Total Items: One antique Elizabethan side chair. One antique French armoire. One Cracked Mug, with a picture of a pug on the side.

Note: I found the furniture in the basement of my old family home. My mother asked me to get rid of it, so I decided to collect some data, from 914, rather than toss them out.

Input: One antique Elizabethan side chair
Setting: Fine
Output: One office swivel chair. All components of the chair are made of wood, the wheels do not move, nor does it swivel. D-51215 sat on the chair, with no other anomalous effects.

Note: It might be stationary, but it's at least a little comfier than it was before.

Input: One antique French armoire
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Two dozen 40 cm ''worms'', comprised entirely of wood. Said worms resemble typical earthworms, with small round heads, found on common furniture beetles. One large seamless wooden box, with 'Worm Food' carved into the sides of the box. The interior was filled with several kilograms of sawdust. D-51215 was instructed to feed the worms, some sawdust. D-51315 received a few splinters in his right hand, from feeding the worms. But was otherwise unharmed.

Note: Woodworms. Good one, SCP-914. I suspect their may have been dormant larva deep in the wood. I'll be sure to spray pesticides next time I run any tests using old furniture. The worms have been safely contained in a glass terrarium and moved for future study and potential SCP classification. With the sawdust as their primary food source. Hopefully they don't develop into something nastier.

Input: One cracked mug.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One mug is now in the shape of a pug's head. The paint used to portray the picture of a pug, now stretched out across the mug, in a faint brown. With the nose and ears being dark brown. And a small white porcelain tongue sits inside the mug. D-51215 moved to pick it up, with his left hand, which prompted the mug to growl aggressively. Assistant Researcher Jack Dickie moved in to attempt retrieval and was greeted with excited barking from the mug.

Note: The mug's kind of difficult to drink out of now, when he's barking. The liquid sloshes inside him. I'm gonna keep him as a pencil holder instead. At least he seems to like me, now I just have to name him.

Note: Great, just turn my testing area into an anomalous pet factory. When these things decide to revolt and, I don't know, burn everyone's tongues simultaneously, don't come complaining to me. - Veritas

Output: An extremely complex diagram comprised of over fifty thousand tiny, intersecting polygons. Every vertex is labeled with a letter and a four-digit number. The measures of some angles and the lengths of some sides are given. The line segment |Y6438K0552| is labeled "x". Although analysis has shown there is enough information to solve for x, attempts to do so are ongoing.

Test 914-0775
Name: Researcher Z. Larua
Date: 15/05/2019
Total Items: 2 cast iron pans, 2 stainless steel lug-nuts

Input: 1 pan, 1 lug-nut
Setting: Fine
Output: A cast iron pot with a stainless steel coating. Displays the anomalous property of heating whatever is within the pot perfectly evenly. Liquids are brought to a boil almost instantly and solids are melted/cooked all the way through. Heat can also be applied to the pot from any direction (except the open top) and will be distributed evenly throughout. Personnel are NOT to place their hands or any part of their body within the pot when there is any source of heat placed on it.

Note: While this cookware is very effective at its purpose, it is also very easy to burn food with it due to its efficiency. Browning and deep-frying food is also impossible due to the complete and thorough cooking of the object. -Larua

Input: 1 pan, 1 lug-nut
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A blackened lug-nut. When placed on a metallic surface, the lug-nut affixes itself to the spot and siphons all heat within a 90cm diameter range to the spot directly under the lug-nut. Under the lug-nut the temperature was shown to be multiplied exponentially. At room temperature this dramatic increase instantly melted most metals that were tested. When removing the lug-nut, the handler must only touch the exterior or suffer severe burns should they touch the interior.

Note: We're seeing if maybe we can use this to liven up the menu choices a bit, seeing as our site doesn't have an infinite pizza box like some locations. -Barkley

Note: They don't actually use it there. It's an SCP so eating from it for no reason is against the rules. - Jane Cho

Note: Oh yeah, using the machine in an attempt to create better condiments, this cannot possibly go wrong. - Veritas

Input: 20kg bag of cinnamon.
Setting: Fine
Output: A 1kg statue of the Egyptian sun deity ''Amon'', made entirely of cinnamon, wearing clothes and jewelry made from the bag. The statue possesses an anomalous quality wherein looking into its eyes compels the viewer to commit some variety of immoral acts.

Note: Well that wasn't anything close to what I was hoping for. Maybe the next one will do something better? -Barkley

Input: 20kg bag of oregano.
Setting: Fine
Output: Five 4kg bags of oregano. No anomalous qualities or other dangers detected. Taste-testing by D-class revealed each cube to have a different taste to them.

Note: Huh. Interesting, but not sure how well these will be received. -Barkley

Total Items: One wooden door with attached frame, one remote exploration drone.

Input: Wooden door with attached frame
Setting: Very fine
Output: One wooden door with attached frame. Resulting door is square, thinner, and with a much larger surface area. Object emerged diagonally to fit within the output booth. The door reveals a spatial anomaly when opened. From the front a darkened, metallic enclosure can be made out. When viewed from behind no anomaly is seen.

Note: Obviously light can reach us from the other side of the anomaly, but that is no guarantee that solid objects will be able to travel both ways. We are going to send in an exploration drone to map out the area and give us some GPS coordinates of its location. - Lombardi

Input: One remote exploration drone
Note: We have determined that the spatial anomaly leads to the input booth of 914. - Lombardi
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A spherical object resembling a cybernetic eye. Object is rough 30 centimeters in diameter. Both sides of the device are equipped with touch interfaces in the shape of stylized hand-prints. Testing has revealed the device grants the operator the ability to observe a volume of space centered around their location, through all sensory means. Initial tests recorded below.

[BEGIN LOG]
Lombardi: D-87273, please pick up the object in front of you.
D-87273 picks up the cybernetic eye, placing her hands on the touch interface in the process.
D-87273: Woah. I can see the entire room.
Lombardi: Please elaborate.
D-87273: It's like I can see and hear everything at once and it's not overwhelming - I'm inside and outside of the room at the same time. I am everywhere. Like - all of you are clothed but I see your bodies as well. I can even see inside them. Brains, guts, everything.
Lombardi: Are you able to control where your vision extends?
D-87273: Yeah, it's like the device is responding to my thoughts. I bet I could see this entire building if I wanted to.
Lombardi: I strongly advise you not to-
D-87273 suddenly shrieks and collapses, presumably from observing every memetic and cognitohazard contained within site-19 simultaneously. D-class slowly rises, babbling and showing signs of rapid body mutation. On-site security quickly terminate and incinerate subject.
[END LOG]

Note: The eye has been confiscated and moved to anomalous item storage. As for the remote-input door, we're keeping that contained until we determine if its utility outweighs the inherent risk, and if we would even able to destroy it without damaging 914. - Lombardi

Note: God damn it, Lombardi, I'm already up to my neck in janitorial complaints and the Security Chief calling me daily, you just had to add the memetic containment department to that list as well. - Veritas

Note: I see a mandatory training seminar for "Effective management of D-class" has been added to my calendar. Point taken. - Lombardi

Test 914-0788
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 15/05/2019
Total Items: A black 1987 Pontiac Firebird, crushed.

Note: The wreck was hauled in on a flatbed trailer that was not used for the test.

Note: I got this from a local scrapyard for $200. I want to see if 914 can straighten it back out. -Prof. Wren

Input: The crushed car.
Setting: Coarse
Output: The parts of the car, separated out. Each part is still crushed beyond recognition, in the exact same fashion as before.

Note: I was anticipating the disassembly, since that's what Coarse tends to do. I was really hoping it would straighten the pieces out in the process, though, and yet somehow it separates them without even altering the condition they're in. It's equal parts fascinating and disappointing. -Prof. Wren

Note: The scrap was returned to the trailer and hauled away to be smelted. Prof. Wren's request for reimbursement on the test was denied. - Veritas

Test 914-0794
Name: Assistant Researcher Jack Dickie, D-51215, D-39992
Date: 17/05/2019
Total Items: Forty eight 330ml cans of Barr's Irn Bru

Note: My goal with this test, is to see how SCP-914 will alter the flavour of this particular soft drink. I'm bringing D-51215 and D-39992 to taste test the results. Prior to testing, both D-Class were given samples of Irn Bru to taste test beforehand.

Input: Twelve 330ml cans of Barr's Irn Bru
Setting: 1:1
Output: Three Cans of 'Real' Irn Bru. D-39992 drank from the first can, and began to complain of stomach pain, shortly afterwards. D-39992 was taken to the medical wing, but expired before arriving. An autopsy revealed that D-39992's stomach and windpipe were ruptured by numerous small aluminium girders, that had expanded in their throat.

Note: It seems 914 took the old slogan. 'Made in Scotland from girders.' quite literally in this case. The aluminium girders explains the missing cans.

Input: Twelve 330ml cans of Barr's Irn Bru
Setting: Fine
Output: Twelve cans of Irn Bru, D-51215 was instructed to open one can, and consume the contents. Upon being opened, the can's content escaped in the form of a orange cloud of carbonated gas.

Input: Six of the Irn Bru cans, from the previous experiment
Setting: 1:1
Output: Three gas grenades, made entirely from aluminium. The exterior of the grenades is labelled as "Barr's Edible Gas". D-51215 tested the grenades, which created a thick cloud of orange mist. When breathed in, the mist would condense on the tongue and form into carbonated Irn Bru.

Input: Twelve 330ml cans of Barr's Irn Bru
Setting: 1:1
Output: A spherical, translucent orange lump, carbonated gasses visibly bubble and move inside of it. The inside of the object sparkles, due to aluminium flakes floating inside of it. The object is the size of a Soccer Ball. It possess a clear membrane, that is permeable if pressed on, and becomes sticky. D-51215'S left hand sunk past this permeable layer and suffered chemical burns, while extracting his hand.

Note: I think 914 increased the acidity of the components that made up the Irn Bru. Not exactly the kind of improvement I was hoping for. We managed to extract it from the output booth, using a shovel. The Result was incinerated, I don't want to chance this thing developing a taste for human flesh or becoming the blob.

Input: Twelve 330ml cans of Barr's Irn Bru
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A 66.6cm tall aluminium statue of Mel Gibson, dressed as William Wallace from the movie, Braveheart. Standing on a small mound of girders. In one hand it held a smaller can of Irn Bru and in the other, it is holding a Scottish flag. The statue is coloured orange, white and blue, like the cans. The statue was held together by a sugary residue, made from the Irn Bru. It fell apart, shortly after being removed from the output box.

Input The Result of the previous test
Setting Rough
Result A pile of scrap aluminium. An orange mist from and a small puddle of blue, white and orange paint.

Note: It deserved to be destroyed. That movie was an affront to historical accuracy. - Assistant Researcher Jack Dickie

Setting: Fine
Output: A large quartz crystal with a rotating handle, labeled "RAINBOWAMETHYST". Turning the handle will change the color of the crystal through unknown means.

Input: 1kg amethyst
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A clockwork machine shaped like a boat, composed entirely of amethyst. Two rotating handles are present on each side(herefore referred to as L1(left front), L2(left rear), R1(right front), R2(right rear) by their relative positions). L1 and R2 can only be rotated counterclockwise, and L2 and R1 can only be rotated clockwise. Rotating any handle individually does not result in anomalous behavior. However, when two or more handles are rotated simultaneously, the machine will act in various anomalous ways. Behavior is recorded below.
L1	L2	R1	R2	Behavior
ON	ON	OFF	OFF	All subjects in contact with the object will be unable to see through their left eye for approximately 23 minutes.
ON	OFF	ON	OFF	A focused beam of red(600~650nm) light will be emitted from the front of the object. The light is not powerful enough to significantly affect any surface.
ON	OFF	OFF	ON	All subjects in contact with the object will simultaneously manifest a saline solution from their eyes. Analysis has shown that the solution is identical in composition to human tears, save for the lack of organic matter.
OFF	ON	ON	OFF	[ Same as above ]
OFF	ON	OFF	ON	Any solid surface in contact with the object's bottom will experience a strong acceleration in the direction facing away from the object. The strength of the acceleration will vary depending on the type of surface.
OFF	OFF	ON	ON	All subjects in contact with the object will be unable to see through their right eye for approximately 23 minutes.
ON	ON	ON	OFF	The song "Happy Birthday To You" will be played by the object.
ON	ON	OFF	ON	All subjects in contact with the handles will simultaneously be led to believe that the R1 handle is made of olivine. Subjects that do not know the mineral will be unaffected.
ON	OFF	ON	ON	The object will become slightly negatively charged, and the surroundings will become slightly positively charged.
OFF	ON	ON	ON	The object will become slightly positively charged, and the surroundings will become slightly negatively charged.
ON	ON	ON	ON	The object will switch color between violet and orange each time all handles are turned simultaneously.

Setting: 1:1
Output: A Scottish Thistle, made of the aluminium cans. The flowering bud is orange and the steam and body of the plant is blue. The metallic roots are white.

Note: This will make a nice conversation piece. I'll keep it in my office.
Note: Turns out it grows as well, I noticed it was growing a new bud. A few days after placing it in a plant pot.

Input: One can of cleaning polish, with a sticky note. The note instructing SCP-914 to give itself a polish.
Setting: Fine
Output: The interior of both the Input and Output booths, have been polished. The can of polish has also been flattened and polished into a highly reflective surface. The sticky note was unchanged and still stuck to the flattened can. D-51215 had difficulty gripping the item. Cutting his hands on the edges of the object. Object was eventually removed, using a pair of latex safety gloves to safely grip and lift it.

Note: It makes a surprisingly good mirror. I've placed the flattened can into a picture frame, so it can be used without cutting anyone's hands.

Test 914-0806
Name: Researcher Graymont
Date: 23/05/2019
Input: 3 broken "Now That's What I Call Music" CDs

Note: Maybe something good can come from running broken CDs through 914 - Graymont

Input: One CD
Setting: Fine
Output: One fixed CD titled "Now That's What I Call Propaganda". Is a CD with propaganda speeches from all over history. Some even from ancient times. No anomalous properties discovered.

Input: One CD
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A disc that weighs the same as the original, but is stretched to be around 400% wider, while reducing the thickness of the disc to what is measured to be a few atoms. Examined by electron microscope. Dents on the surface are formed by removal of single atoms across the disc, which can be read as data. Partial translation shows that it might contain every song ever recorded. Very difficult to handle, impossible to be read automatically due to the precision required and the disc being extremely fragile.

Test 914-0807
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 23/05/2019
Total Items: 3 blank VHS tapes with pictures of various research personnel on the labels.

Note: We've seen some…I suppose "interesting" is the word?…results regarding photos. Let's see what happens here. -Prof. Wren

Input: A VHS tape labeled with a photo of Researcher Darby.
Setting: Fine
Output: A VHS tape labeled "Foundation Daze: Seriously Crazy Pratfalls." Footage on the tape shows accidents throughout the SCP Foundation, including personnel injuries, containment breaches, and [REDACTED], all set to a laugh track and voiced over by Tom Bergeron. All depicted incidents confirmed to have never happened.

Note: Suggest making this available to everyone, because some of these were pretty funny. -Prof. Wren

Input: A VHS tape labeled with a photo of Dr. Veritas.
Setting: Fine
Output: A VHS tape labeled "Dr. Veritas' Circus Calamitus." Footage on the tape shows various 914 research personnel performing multiple circus acts, such as Researcher Darby juggling knives on a tightrope, with Dr. Veritas visibly struggling in his role as ringmaster while trying to keep the acts from ending in disaster. Footage ends 23 minutes in with the circus tent bursting into flames.

Input: A VHS tape labeled with a photo of Dr. Nukea.
Setting: Fine
Output: A VHS tape labeled as a copy of 17 Again. Footage on the tape is a continuous 5-hour "TV Color Test" overlayed with the sound of the Emergency Broadcast System.

Note: What surprises me about this is exactly how unsurprising it is. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0808
Name: Researcher Lombardi
Date: 23/05/2019
Total Items: 2 paper cups connected by string

Input: 2 paper cups connected by string
Setting: Very Fine
Output: What appears to be the handset and phone cable of a 1980's era analog telephone, constructed out of the paper, wax coating, and string. Object is extremely light and shows a higher-than-expected level of durability. Handset has no buttons, but successfully produced a dial tone when connected to a closed phone network. Careful inspection has revealed that the interior of the phone is not hollow as initially expected, instead containing a series of thin wax capsules.

Input: Output of previous test
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A Dixie branded cellphone. Object has undergone extensive analysis from Foundation experts in cognitohazards, chemical and electronic manufacturing, physics, forensics and security. Like the handset, object shows durability and structural integrity matching that of traditional cellphones despite being constructed from paper, wax, and string fibers. The phone runs a variant of Android known as CupOS. The internal clock is set to the year 2039. Thanks to a massive quantity of cached internet files on the device, a Foundation forensics team has been able to piece together a likely history.

The device originates from a timeline where a CK-class event has wiped out most metals, and made metalloids unsuitable for use in circuitry and electronics. In the chaos of such an event, The Foundation and other GOI banded together to form the 'Rebirth Initiative'. This organization became the dominant political force on the planet, restoring order and then rebuilding civilization. They partnered with the Dixie Corporation to reproduce modern technology with anomalously enhanced organic components - phones such as this being the culmination of 15+ years of development.

The cause of the CK-event has been theorized to be a reaction between SCP-████ and another uncontained anomaly. Security procedures around SCP-████ have been heightened in light of this revelation.

Note: I've spent a month interacting with what seems like every department in the Foundation to gain understanding of a Dixie Cup cellphone. It's a feat of anomalous engineering - the inside is filled with wax crystals formed into photonic circuitry. Wren, our resident acoustics expert discovered the nearly invisible network of string fibers running between them. Apparently they store information, energy, and calculations in twist, tension, and vibration. She dubbed the system 'Unified on-board acoustic co-processing and memory'. This is the first time I've seen a logic behind that activity that could be dissected. Have I mentioned we had to do all the testing in a custom Faraday cage to ensure the phone wouldn't connect to a public network? It felt like arts and crafts day when we built the enclosure; the inside was traditional while a second layer was built from string and wax. - Lombardi

Test 914-0809
Name: Dr. Terren
Date: 23/05/2019
Total items: One can of Pepsi and a can of Coca Cola

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Two cans of A&W cream soda. The liquid inside of the cans has an anomalous effect of never staining any surface. The liquid stays on top of the surface & doesn’t impact the surroundings.

Note: I wish I could create more of these. They would be really useful. -Terren

Test 914-0810
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 23/05/2019
Total Items: 3 electronic fly swatters, designed to run on 4 AA batteries.

Note: For those who don't know, these are basically bug zappers shaped like tennis racquets. [REDACTED] was having a clearance sale on them, so I figured, why not? For all we know this might wind up creating something that can kill SCP-682 or something. -Prof. Wren

Input: A swatter.
Setting: Fine
Output: At first glance, an unaltered swatter. Switching it on, however, causes the head of the swatter to glow blue and produce a low hum, producing varied noises when swung or switched off. D-class testing the device expired after touching the head against orders and suffering a fatal electrical shock. Device instantly switched off afterwards due to the batteries being drained.

Note: What he thought was going to happen from touching what was effectively the blade of Maria Sharapova's lightsaber is beyond me, but I guess this is why we have these guys. -Prof. Wren

Input: A swatter.
Setting: Fine
Output: The same swatter, but with the wires forming the "strike zone" of the head missing. Objects passing through the now-empty hoop while it is active are exposed to a localized electromagnetic pulse contained completely within the "strike zone." EMP is strong enough to completely destroy unprotected electronics.

Note: Well that's just useless. Okay, time to wrap this test up with a VF run. Heads up, everyone. -Prof. Wren

Input: A swatter.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A "swatter-drone" with 2 wings comprised of the head split down the middle (forming 2 full heads at half thickness) and attached to the handle. Drone hovers in the air via electromagnetic propulsion. Drone appears to hover in place, moving only when pushed, unless a flying insect enters within a vicinity of approx. 20 meters of it, at which point it will fly directly at the insect at a clocked air speed of 35 km/h and slapping its wings together, electrocuting the insect and reducing it to ash. Wings are otherwise safe to the touch. D-class suffered 3rd-degree facial burns during testing when a gnat landed on his nose.

Note: This will be handy if we can just get it to quit swatting bugs while they're on people. Sweet. -Prof. Wren

Note: As of time of writing the drone has remained in air for 7 hours 43 minutes; means of the batteries producing the power for this not yet known, likely an effect of running the batteries through on the "Very Fine" setting.

Note: Due to its method of levitation, the floor of SCP-914’s testing chamber is now heated to over 100 degrees Celsius. Object has been deactivated and put in anomalous storage. Personnel are prohibited from entering the room until it cools off. - Security Chief Sedna

Note: Okay, so that's two design flaws. My bad. Shouldn't be too difficult to install a remote on/off function directly inline with the power supply, though. Now if you'll excuse me, my ears are still ringing from getting an earful from Dr. Veritas, and I have a security manual to re-read. -Prof. Wren

Note: From here on, the first two tests on course and rough will be omitted unless a something inconsistent happens. - Graymont

Input: One pair of shoes
Setting: 1:1
Output: One pair of [REDACTED] brand shoes

Input: One pair of shoes
Setting: Fine
Output: Visually similar pair of shoes. They have the cognitohazardous property of causing the nearest person to try to put them on. Notably, once on, no force thus far has been able to separate D-17939 from the shoes, they are unable to be taken off. D-Class notes that despite this, the shoes are extremely comfortable.

Test 914-0816
Name: Doctor Starr
Date: 26/05/2019
Total Items: Four tablets of ███████ brand painkiller (The same used for the first “914 Brand Painkiller” test), four D-Class Personnel employed for testing the results, and a handful of “914 Brand Painkiller” in case of the creation of “914 Brand Pain”

I am going to be working a lot with “914 Brand Painkiller” and potentially “914 Brand Pain” so they will be relabeled “9BPK” and “9BP” respectively for future tests. Today’s testing revolves around the hypothesis that SCP-914 refines around the user’s perception of the input, SCP-914, or the potential output. I have enlisted the help of four D-Class, each of which have unique experiences or knowledge about “9BPK” or “9BP”. I do intend to run into “9BP” during this test so appropriate measures in place. - Doctor Starr

Input: One tablet of ███████ brand painkiller
Setting: Fine (Operated by D-Class who has experience with only “9BPK”)
Output: A more advanced version of “9BPK” that has an increased duration of 36 hours and an a pleasant aftertaste.

Had I not used only one tablet, I definitely would have had the team reverse engineer these as an alternative for patients dealing with continuous pain. -Doctor Starr

Input: One tablet of ███████ brand painkiller
Setting: Fine (Operated by D-Class with experience with “9BP” and subsequently “9BPK”)
Output: “9BP” with an increased duration to 24 hours and the added effect of resisting “9BPK” entirely. D-Class was returned to confinement with a nurse until the effects wore off.

Input: One tablet of ███████ brand painkiller
Setting: Fine (Operated by D-Class with limited knowledge of only “9BPK”)
Output: A slightly worse version of "9BPK" that lasts half as long and has many common negative side-effects, such as indigestion, dizziness, and fatigue.

Input: One tablet of ███████ brand painkiller
Setting: Fine (Operated by D-Class with limited knowledge of only “9BP”)
Output: A blank tablet of the same size, shape, and color as the input. Lab analysis says it is the same tablet as the input and is safe for ingestion. An anomalous tablet that, when mixed with D-24615’s stomach acid three seconds after digestion, started a extremely volatile reaction that D-24615 described as burning before their stomach exploded. The end result left a fifteen centimeter wide hole in D-24615’s torso with burn marks along the inside of the chest cavity. Although D-Class had both missing and damaged vital organs, subject did not die for over an hour. More symptoms appeared as an infection spread across their body, including but not limited to [REDACTED]. Subject terminated at their own request. An autopsy revealed the words “Do No Harm” were repeatedly burned in microscopic lettering onto the entire exposed interior of the corpse before being incinerated.

Test 914-0817
Name: Dr. Hort
Date: 26/05/2019
Total Items: 2 five litre tanks filled with O2

Note: The input and output chamber were purged of all air before the test.

Input: Tank with O2
Setting: Coarse
Output: The output booth was filled with O2 gas, and plastic pieces were placed in the floor. It is unknown if the O2 molecules were separated into oxygen atoms, and joined back together before the output was analysed.

Input: Tank with O2
Setting: Fine
Output: Tank with an unknown gas. When D-8723 approached the tank, the content ignited and exploded, killing him. 914 didn’t receive any damage. It is theorised that the carbon in the plastic molecules of the tank was separated and ignited with the oxygen.

Test 914-0818
Name: Assistant Researcher Takahashi
Date: 27/05/2019
Total Items: One copy of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, one vinyl record of Queen’s 1977 News of the World album.

Input: News of the World.
Setting: Fine
Output: A copy of News of the World with Freddie Mercury, Brian May, and Roger Taylor’s vocals all taken from live performances, even the songs that were never performed live. Interestingly enough, the instrumentals are the same as the studio versions.

Note: I hope it's not weird that I can identify every performance every song came from. - Assistant Researcher Takahashi

Input: Super Smash Bros Ultimate.
Setting: Fine
Output: A copy of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, but some characters have been replaced or removed altogether. Every character's replacement is a character from the same series of the replaced character. Some characters that have been replaced are: King Dedede with the character Waddle Dee, Ken with the character Akuma, Piranha Plant with Toad. Removed characters include Toon Link, Mr. Game and Watch, and Dark Samus.

Note: I have mixed feelings on this., but that's 914 for you. - Assistant Researcher Takahashi

Test 914-0819
Name: Dr. Ira
Date: 27/05/2019
Total Items: Three uncut loaves of Fresh baked bread

Note: There's a ton of this stuff sitting in the breakroom. We held a farewell party for Aniyah now that her transfer request was processed. She baked far too much of this stuff. It is great, however! There's more in the breakroom if anyone wants any. Save some for everyone else. - Dr. Ira

Input: A loaf of bread
Setting: Fine
Output: An anomalously rotating undecorated cake. The instance was much smaller in size than the loaf used; this is theorized to be the result of less air pockets than there were in the bread.

Input: A loaf of bread
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small phonograph entirely made from bread. It continuously emitted the smell of fresh bread while activated. The instance played the 'Happy Birthday' song as expected of a normal phonograph. A small button on the back can be used to turn the item on and off; this disables both the smell and sound of the item.

Note: I don't think 914 can read the room. Let's tell it that this was from a farewell party. - Dr.Ira

Input: A loaf of bread, a knife was used to write 'farewell' into the outer crust.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Conversion process took 30 seconds longer than usual for items of this size. When complete, an animate bread figure walked from the output chamber. It walked in circles, weeping, before falling over after 2 hours of continuous sobbing. Upon expiration, the instance was incinerated under orders of Junior Researcher Judith. The smell of baked bread has not removed itself from the incinerator since; 146 hours and counting.

Note: Poor thing. It must think that we're getting rid of it. - Junior Researcher Judith

Note: This is exactly why you don’t just incinerate anomalous objects. Junior Researcher Judith is banned from using the incinerator to destroy anomalies from now on. - Security Chief Sedna

Output: One extremely detailed satellite map of Japan, South Korea, North Korea, and the Kuril Islands, 1:1000 scale. Result placed in secure storage.
Note: Not what I'm looking for, 914. And I don't know how it managed to mangle the conversion process. - Dr. Cleveland

Input: 1Q84
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Two copies of Never Let Me Go. The first is the unaltered 2005 novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, which has been placed in the break room. The second is a copy altered in a similar manner to how SCP-3922 does to fictional videos, and with the original protagonist, Kathy H., rendered as a deuteragonist, paving way for a group of people, similar to SCP-3922-A instances in appearance, to start an egalitarian socialist revolution in Hailsham, England. This copy has been placed in anomalous storage.

Test 914-0821

Date: 27/05/2019
Total Items: 1 cardboard box, 32cm x 32cm x 18cm in size, 1 12-piece set of Garfield-themed porcelain dinner plates.

Note: The original plan was just to test the plates, but as long I've got the box they came in…eh, why not? -Prof. Wren

Input: The box.
Setting: Fine
Output: A fully functional, miniature replica of SCP-914. Input booth located at top of the replica, output booth at the bottom.

Note: Oh my god! You guys, this is incredible! This is…wow. Okay, deep breaths…right. Let's see how well this one functions, shall we? -Prof. Wren

Note: Second half of experiment conducted using the replica 914.

Input: All 12 plates.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 157 miniature plates of various sizes.

Note: Aww, I bet some of these would work nicely in a doll hou

Output: The same box, now with a memetic property wherein anyone who looks at it perceives it to be a perfect copy of SCP-914, operated by inserting objects into the top of the box (perceived as the input booth) and upending the box (perceived as turning the mainspring key). Objects falling out of the box are perceived as exiting the output booth in an improved state. Altered perception remains for approximately 7 minutes. Repeated exposure does not appear to reproduce the effect. The box has been placed in storage for further study.

Note: Umm….huh. Okay, yeah, that was embarrassing. Could someone get me a broom and a dust pan, please? -Prof. Wren

Note: Uh, I usually don’t comment on other people’s tests, but the second-largest ‘miniature plate’ looks really aesthetically pleasing. Can I have it? I want to make a larger sized replica of that. - Researcher Jane Cho

Note: Eh, sure. One less shattered fragment of Odie's visage for me to clean up, I suppose. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0822
Name: Assistant Researcher Jack Dickie, D-51215
Date: 27/05/2019
Total Items: One old petrol lawnmower. One broken electric lawnmower. One set of stiff garden shears. Six black refuse bags filled with dry grass. Two Black Refuse Bags, filled with dried out hedge trimmings. Six cracked garden Gnomes. Three broken rakes. One hedge trimmer, with a broken blade.

Note: I tidied up my garden about three weeks ago, and I had a lot of old garden equipment taking up space in the garden shed. Plus I had to dispose of this garden waste properly. Today's test is primarily going to be aimed at improving or repairing the gardening equipment. Due to the number of blades on some of the equipment. I've prepared a few potted shrubs to test the results and I've requisitioned Kevlar armour for both myself and D-51215 in case of potential stabbing injuries.

Input: One petrol lawnmower, one electric lawnmower.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A larger lawnmower, with a blade, similar in design to a helicopter propeller. The engine has been redesigned to run on battery power. With a smaller tank for petrol, similar in concept to a hybrid engine. The new lawnmower was filled with petrol and its battery was charged, after plugging it into a power socket, for twenty minutes. Upon being activated, the lawnmower generated enough speed to lift itself off the ground. Hovering 50 centimetres over the ground.

Note: Well it's useless as a lawnmower, since it hovers too high to cut the grass properly. But the engine design might be useful. We should be able to reverse engineer it.

Input: One set of garden shears
Setting: 1:1
Output: The blades of the shears are shinier, but the pointed tips of the shears have been rounded. Similar in appearance to a pair of safety scissors. D-51215 was instructed to trim a small potted shrub with the shears. The shrub was cut cleanly in two by the shears, with little to no effort on D-51215's part. A second test was conducted, with D-51215 instructed to cut through a sheet of paper. The blades could not cut the paper, D-51215 described feeling like he was trying to cut into solid stone.

Input: One hedge trimmer, with a broken chain.
Setting: Fine
Output: The hedge trimmer's blade has been reduced significantly and reshaped into a circular saw. The chain used to cut hedges has been modified into a shoulder strap, to make carrying it, much simpler. D-51215 was instructed to use the new hedge trimmer on a potted shrub. Upon starting the saw, the chain began to spin alongside the circular saw and cut into D-51215's Kevlar. D-51215 was startled and released the hedge trimmer. Which continued to operate, pieces of the blade and chain were scattered around the testing area as the new hedge trimmer mangled itself.

Input: Three broken rakes. Six Cracked Garden Gnomes
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Six garden gnomes, coated in a sheet of melted plastic and metal. Each gnome is holding a small piece of gardening equipment. A garden hoe, a rake, a pair of shears, a shovel, a watering can and a garden brush. The tools are made of the material from the rakes, and the metallic coating also appears to be from the rakes. Result was inert when D-51215 removed them from the output booth. When placed near one of the potted shrubs prepared for testing, all six gnomes began moving. Beginning to trim, water, and shift the topsoil of the plant pot. Source of the water, in the watering can is unknown. The six gnomes became inert after thirty minutes. Resuming their original poses. Result moved to anomalous storage for further study and potential SCP classification.

Input: Six black refuse bags filled with dry grass. Two Black Refuse Bags, filled with dried out hedge trimmings.
Setting: Rough 1:1
Output: A four foot tall, humanoid figure. The hedge trimmings have been weaved and bent, into the shape of a pork pie hat, that sits on its head. The figure is coated in thick black plastic from the refuse bags and is filled with the dry grass and leftover hedge trimmings. The result was removed from the output booth and displayed no anomalous properties until brought near one of the potted shrubs. Causing it to screech shrilly, causing D-51215 to flee in terror. D-51215 refused to go near the result for twenty minutes. Upon approaching the object again, D-51215 was shrieked at by the result. But was able to resist fleeing again and moved the potted shrub away from it. Result was inert after the potted shrub was taken away and was moved to anomalous item storage.

Note: Ah right, it's a scarecrow. Assistant Researcher Jack Dickie

Total Items: One DVD copy of the 1987 film Prince of Darkness, one photo of Tegan and Sara performing in Indio, California

Input: Prince of Darkness
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A DVD, which when placed into any DVD player, shows a Blue Screen of Death seen in computers using Windows XP for 102 minutes. While the dialogue remains unchanged, every time a character says a noun for which has a German counterpart that is neuter in gender, the screen becomes increasingly distorted. At the end of the playback, one could hear Andrei Chikatilo, Dr. Everett Mann, Steve Jobs, Geraldine Ferraro, and SCP-114 saying the infamous "We begin bombing in five minutes" outtake by Ronald Reagan in unison. Should anyone be looking at the screen within five minutes after this point, he or she would cease to exist. Result placed in anomalous storage.

Note: We lost two confused D-class and one security officer to this movie. I'm having a headache. - Dr. Cleveland

Input: Photo of Tegan and Sara
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A photo of Fleetwood Mac performing in Holmdel Township, New Jersey on May 29, 2004. A vaguely humanoid entity is seen in the background, with the population of Mongolia correct as of 29/05/2004 (251████) imprinted upon. Touching the photo directly causes one to identify as a Sam Howell from [DATA EXPUNGED], Louisiana for five hours. Result confiscated by Security Chief.

Note: Excuse me, but who exactly was Mr. Howell? I'm so confused. - Dr. Cleveland

Date: 27/05/2019
Total Items: Five Whittling Knives. Five blocks of carving wood.

Note: So far I've seen what SCP-914 can do with old and broken items. I'm going to see what 914 can do with free reign to be creative.

Input: One whittling knife and one block of carving wood. With a sticky note attached to the block, saying: ''Be creative''.
Setting: Fine
Output: The Block of wood emerged unaltered, while the whittling knife had been twisted into a corkscrew and stabbed into the top of the wooden block. Pinning the sticky note onto it.

Input: One whittling knife and one block of carving wood. A sticky note is attached to the block, stating: ''Please be creative''.
Setting: 1:1
Output: The block of wood has been cut into multiple smooth strips of wood, resembling chopsticks. The handle of the whittling knife has also been turned into smooth strips of wood. The blade is unchanged.

Input: One whittling knife and one block of carving wood. A sticky note is attached to the block, stating: Be as creative as you like.
Setting: Fine
Output: The block of wood has been cut into 74 small blocks. Piled on top of each other, the blocks are of similar shape and design to Jenga pieces. The sticky note has been folded neatly into a smaller square next to it.

Note: Jenga is one of my favourite games! Maybe 914 wants to play? - Assistant Researcher Dickie

Input: The previous result, with a block from the bottom, moved to the top.
Setting: 1:1
Output: The Jenga tower has a block from the middle removed and placed on top. D-51215 attempted to lift it out. Causing the tower to collapse and then reassemble itself, in its original configuration, from the previous test.

Input: One whittling knife and one block of carving wood. A sticky note is attached, stating: ''show off your creativity''.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The block of wood has D-51215's face carved into it. And the whittling knife has been stabbed up to the hilt, in the block of wood.

Input: One whittling knife and one block of carving wood
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The block of wood has been carved and hollowed out into the shape of a mug. The mug itself is filled with pieces of the block of wood and sawdust. The whittling blade has been stretched thin and acts as an inner lining of the mug. Similar in design to the metallic coating found in thermos cups. The handle was turned into sawdust inside the mug.

Test 914-0825
Name: Assistant Researcher Takahashi
Date: 27/05/2019
Total Items: 3 Dragon Ball Z VHS tapes.
Note: I can’t watch these because I don’t have a VHS player anymore, so I might as well put them to good use. - Assistant Researcher Takahashi
Input: One VHS tape.
Setting: Coarse
Output: An empty cassette next to a neatly folded roll of film.
Note: Aw, that’s nice of you, 914. Less for me to clean up! - Assistant Researcher Takahashi

Input: One VHS tape.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A VHS tape of an English-subbed anime based on Mazinger Z titled Defender 914: Kaiju Fighter featuring a protagonist resembling Dr. Veritas who controls SCP-914 in a ''Gundam''-like mecha form fighting multiple ''Kaiju''. The VHS is dated 1989, but there is no record of this anime ever existing during that year.

Note: It's surprisingly good? The plot’s amazing. Good on you for being a not boring anime protagonist, Veritas. - Assistant Researcher Takahashi

Note: Takahashi showed me the tape. A depiction of me tearing the head off a giant… what seems to be cyborg lizard, is not something I expected to see this morning, but here we are. - Veritas

Input: One VHS tape.
Setting: Fine
Output: A sculpture of the Dragon Ball Z character Vegeta made out of a VHS tape. Anyone within 1.5 meters of the sculpture will begin to talk like the character for the next 10 minutes. After the result's destruction, the effect stopped.

Note: I have a headache from so many people screaming about besting Kakarrot and being the prince of all Saiyans. Result incinerated. - Assistant Researcher Takahashi

Test 914-0827
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 28/05/2019
Total Items: An assortment of 60 Magic: the Gathering cards.

Note: Relax, this is just a random old deck of mine from when I first started playing. I'm not running an Alpha Edition Black Lotus through or anything. -Prof. Wren

Input: All 60 cards.
Setting: Coarse
Output: The same 60 cards, sorted in order by color, card type, mana cost, and name.

Note: Huh. I was definitely expecting a pile of cardboard and a puddle of ink here. Also, I'm just going to assume that the idea I just had of putting my entire collection through on this setting is preemptively denied and move on. -Prof. Wren

Input: All 60 cards.
Setting: 1:1
Output: The same 60 cards, shuffled.

Note: Huh. I thought for sure that would have turned them into Pokémon cards or something. Still, I guess this is about as "one for one" as it gets. -Prof. Wren

Input: All 60 cards.
Setting: Fine
Output: A 60-card deck of blank cards with matching fronts and backs. Both sides of the cards are now a red-and-white kaleidoscope of gears with the SCP Foundation seal in the center, mirrored to create a completely symmetrical design. A minor anomalous property has been noted where shuffling the cards induces a mildly euphoric state; the effect gradually wears off over a course of 38 to 45 seconds, leaving the user in a much more relaxed state than before. After the effect wears off, the anomalous property is replaced with one where the gears printed on the card can be seen to slowly rotate for a period of 4 hours; the cards return to their previous state at this time.

Note: Given how much more he needs them than us, I'm taking these straight to Dr. Veritas' office. …Riiight after I give them one last shuffle. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0828

Name: Intern Snevets
Date: 31/05/2019
Total Items: One daughter board from an Asus Eee PC, one 3.5mm audio connector.

Note: Visiting from the electronic anomalies team. The audio input on my laptop is really choppy, and it seems to be an issue with the jack, so I want to see if 914 can swap it out. - Intern Snevets

Input: All above.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A very small mechanical I/O kit, designed to fit into an unknown machine. The kit uses gears to transfer kinetic energy, a set of movable pins for data, and several thin plastic filaments to convey audio.

Note: I'm going to hold onto this until I figure out what it connects to. - Intern Snevets

Test 914-0830
Name: Assistant Researcher Jack Dickie, D-51215
Date: 31/05/2019
Total Items: Three lava lamps. Two plasma ball lamps. Two water bubble lamps, with plastic fish inside.

Note: I was passing by one of those thrift stores, and these lamps were selling dirt cheap. I decided to see what 914 could do, to improve upon them.

Input: One lava lamp
Setting: 1:1
Output: The same lava lamp as before. When plugged in, the mercury and the liquid inside reached a boiling point, the bulb burst however, before the liquid could shatter the glass. Result disposed of appropriately.

Input: One plasma lamp
Setting: 1:1
Output: One plasma ball lamp. When plugged in, the plasma ball caused a black out on site. Due to draining all the power. Result was unplugged, and lit up afterwards. Result has stayed on, and remains active. When D-51215 attempted to pick up the result, after it had been unplugged, he suffered an electrical shock. Which he compared to having the same impact of a taser. Result was lifted with rubber gloves and incinerated.

Input: One water bubble lamp
Setting: 1:1
Output: The fish inside the lamp have been melted and fused together into a multicoloured segmented eel. Colours match the fish that were previously in the lamp before. Eel moves up and down the tube, and shows no anomalous properties.

Input: Two lava lamps. One plasma ball lamp. One Water bubble lamp
Setting: 1:1
Output: The glass and bases of the two lava lamps have been moulded together to form one large lava lamp. The base of the lamp, contains the plasma ball lamp. The plastic fish appear to have been melted down and blended with the mercury. Small fish made of the mercury swim inside the lamp. When plugged in, the lamp begins to bubble gently, similarly to air pumps, used in commercial fish tanks. An electrical buzz can be heard in the base of the lamp, where the plasma ball is located. Fish inside appear to be sentient and swim in simple circular patterns. Until tiring and sinking down into the mercury in the base of the glass. Where the fish will emerge once more. Fish have reacted to tapping on the glass and have been shown absorbing small blobs of mercury and oxygen bubbles, created inside the lamp.

Note: This will make a nice reading lamp, for my desk. AR Dickie

Note: Yeah, definitely not. If that thing releases even a few micrograms of liquid or gaseous Mercury, the entire Site is in danger. Result placed in Hazardous Chemical storage. - Veritas

Output: One sword, weighing 3kg. The blade has no edges, and the handle is a perfect cylinder.

Input: One iron plate shaped like a heart.
Setting: Very fine
Output: One iron model of a human heart, weighing 3kg. The heart produces a mechanical sound similar to the one SCP-914 makes, with the addition of a sound commonly described as a large hammer hitting metal. This sound wave is produced near 70 times per minute, but can increase up to 120 times per minute depending on who is standing near the object.

Test 914-0832
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 31/05/2019
Total Items: 1 stone sphere attracted to Researcher Jane Cho, from previous test

Note: Whenever I go into Cell 109-A to put something away, this thing rolls around in its locker and makes weird noises. Seen as it isn’t very interesting as-is, I’m putting it back in 914. - Jane Cho

Input: Moving stone sphere
Setting: 1:1
Output: A floating regular tetrahedron made of granite. It appears to be attracted to the nearest person, and will fly towards the subject and hover near their head.

Note: I should have just put cotton stuffing in the locker. - Jane Cho

Test 914-0833
Name: Junior Researcher Irondu
Date: 31/05/2019
Total Items: One apple pie, one bowl of peach crumble, one bowl of blueberry crumble

Input: The aforementioned items.

Test 914-0834
Name: Junior Researcher Steven
Date: 31/05/2019
Total Items: Six 1cm3 iron cubes, painted white, yellow, green, purple, black, and red. Five grams of paint was added to each cube.

Note: 914 always sorts the output of rough, but how will it deal with color? - JR Steven

Input: Painted iron cubes, dropped in randomly
Setting: Rough
Output: A 6cm3 cube of iron, spots of paint in a line randomly ordered. From left to right: black, white, green, red, purple, yellow.

Upon further inspection they were ordered by the atomic number of the element that gave the paint its color. Carbon-12, titanium-22, chromium-24, iron-26, cobalt-27 and cadmium-48

Note: I'm glad those paints were all water soluble. I was getting ready to find a chisel. Also, I've got the cube left. Surely 914 can't hurt me with 50 grams of iron -JR Steven

Input: Small cube of iron
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Miniature paint pot. Anything placed in it gets painted a random color

Note: I now have a green finger. Might keep the paint pot anyway -JR Steven

Test 914-0835
Name: Dr. Matism
Date: 31/05/2019
Items: Dr. Matism's 2 plane tickets to [REDACTED].

Input: The 2 tickets
Setting: Fine
Output: One indulgence approximately the mass of the two tickets. The indulgence is signed with Pope Francis's name. No discrepancies can be identified between said signature and an actual sample.

Note: For those of you who don't know what an indulgence is, its just a slip of paper signed by the Pope that pretty much gives you free access to Heaven. I'm keeping this just in case - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0836
Date: 31/05/2019
Name: Prof. Wren
Total Items: 3 Casio synthesizer keyboards, 1 each of the following game consoles: Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, Sony Playstation.

Note: Been a while since I've done a musical experiment. Maybe 914'll be nice and give me something to make chiptunes with. As a precautionary measure, however, I'm having everyone present wear hearing protection. If nothing else, the PSX test may involve its startup noise, and that sucker is loud. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 keyboard, the SNES.
Setting: Fine
Output: A 32-key synthesizer stylized in the fashion of the "Super Scope" SNES accessory. Pressing a key has no effect causes a person in the device's line of fire to hear a digitized note.

Note: Neat, but kinda useless. If we could amplify the volume on this thing, however, I suppose it could be used as a sort of sonic weapon. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 keyboard, the Genesis.
Setting: Fine
Output: A small spherical synthesizer, blue in color. Attempting to press any key causes it to begin to rotate 1/8" in the air, parallel to the ground. Rotation begins at 200 RPM and accelerates to speeds determined by the note pressed before dropping back to the ground and rolling away at speeds exceeding 120km/h. Unit destroyed after colliding with the testing area door after a 5th-octave B-flat was pressed.

Input: 1 keyboard, the PSX.
Setting: Fine
Output: A synthesizer with an attached compact disc tray similar to that of the input console. The first note pressed during a song is played at volumes exceeding 170 decibels; effect does not repeat unless the instrument is untouched for a period of at least 128 seconds. The CD tray functions normally for music CDs, but has the same volume effect on the first 20 seconds of any song played.

Note: D-class performing the test was terminated by a massive sonic concussive blast from the device while testing the CD tray. The shockwave ruptured internal organs.

Test 914-0837
Name: Assistant Researcher Erickson
Date: 31/05/2019
Total Items: 3 metal spoons

Input: 1 metal spoon
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 metal fork

Input: 1 metal spoon
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 metal spork. Of note, the item has been constructed in a way that it actually works as both a fork and spoon. The tines of the fork are shaped in a sloped manner so that they catch liquid that would other wise fall out of the spoon, and the spoon is shaped in a half pipe with a sloped back, so that there is no curvature which prevents it from tearing food to shreds when pushed in past the tines. Non-anomalous.

Input: 1 metal spoon
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 bent metal spoon.

When Assistant Researcher Erickson viewed the input booth, he appeared extremely confused, repeatedly stating “The booth is empty” and “there is no spoon”. Upon picking the object up and handing it to him, it phased through his hands. It appears that he is unable to interact with or perceive the spoon.- Researcher Graymont

Date: 31/05/2019
Total Items: One [REDACTED]-brand boomerang.

Input: One boomerang.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A boomerang labeled "Loopster". Upon being thrown, the boomerang travels in a complete circle and collides with the thrower on the back of the head.

Note: It's a neat toy, albeit a little painful. I'd like to file a request to keep it. - Junior Researcher Irondu.

Note: It's your brain. - Veritas

Test 914-0839
Name: Junior Researcher Steven
Date: 03/06/2019
Total Items: 50 one kg blocks of iron

Note: I want to investigate the possible use of 914 to dispose of unusual items. I rather enjoy having colored paperclips and so require a few items to test. I will be performing multiple very fine tests, so a D-64012 equiped with non-conductive body armor will retrieve the output - JR Steven

Input: One kg block of iron
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A metal mallard duck. Very fine craftsmanship

Note: In no way unusual. I threw it into water and it just sank. Oh well, plenty more cubes -JR Steven

Input: One kg block of iron
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One kg of very fine iron dust. No unusual properties.

Input: One kg block of iron
Setting: Very fine
Output: 100 metal ducklings. No seams or welds anywhere. They float on water, but this is due to having a large amount of air inside them. No unusual properties

Input: One kg block of iron
Setting: Very fine
Output: Approximately 100 meters of very fine 28 gauge wire. Normal electrical conductance.

Input: One kg block of iron
Setting: Very fine
Output: Ten pads of very fine, 200, grit sandpaper made of iron

[Tests 6-25 removed for brevity. Very fine was applicable to all output or it was well crafted watefowl]

Note: All test results had no unusual properties, which is uncommon. I'm not sure what was up with all the waterfowl. JR Steven

Name: Researcher A. Dross
Date: 03/06/2019
Total items: Beretta A400 semi-automatic shotgun, Berreta M9 Pistol.

Input: Above mentioned firearms.
Setting: Fine
Output: Heavy handheld shotgun, branded as a "Beretta D05 Shotgun". Weapon contains an internal magazine with a capacity of 4+1 shells. When fired, the recoil is strong enough to shatter the wrist of the user.

Note: Dross was admitted to the medical bay. - Veritas

Test 914-0841
Name: Prof. Wren, Assistant Janitor Wakowski
Date: 03/06/2019
Total Items: Five 25 liter containers of "industrial purple" multi-surface sanitizer/cleaner, purple in color with a typical "cleaning fluid" smell.

Note: Wakowski put in a formal request a few days ago, hoping to use 914 to make something to better keep the facility clean with. While his request was denied, I've gotten him clearance to observe this test and offered to run it myself. Personally, I'm kinda hoping at least one of these goes horribly wrong so that people will stop getting the idea of using an unpredictable SCP to make their jobs easier. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 container.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A 25 liter container of "landfill lime" multi-surface sanitizer/cleaner, now green in color and smelling like rotting garbage.

Note: Yeah, needless to say this one went straight in the incinerator. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 container
Setting: 1:1
Output: 2 2.5-gallon containers of "agricultural yellow" sanitizer/cleaner, now yellow in color and smelling like fertilizer.

Note: Wakowski asked that we try a higher setting, since clearly 1:1 was getting nowhere. I wholeheartedly agree; these previous test results stink in every sense of the term. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 container
Setting: Fine
Output: A plastic, pump-action water rifle with a 25 liter capacity, filled with the "industrial purple" solution. Pumping the handle shoots a spray of roughly 207ml of fluid over a distance of less than 2 meters.

Input: 1 container
Setting: Fine
Output: A large plastic disc filled with 25 liters of the "industrial purple" solution. No means of removing the solution without destroying the disc has been found.

Note: Well, those were kinda useless. Wakowski wanted to try Very Fine on the last one, so be warned. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 container
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small plastic container with a plastic cap on top. Container found to contain 25 liters of the "industrial purple" solution under extreme pressure.

Note: D-class testing the device was terminated upon removing the cap, which caused the container to explode, strike him with high-velocity plastic projectiles, and scour much of his face off with high-pressure chemical spray.

Note: I suspect Wakowski and I are both going to get our asses chewed for that one, but hopefully this gets the point across to the rest of the Site staff. Silver lining, at least the cleanup crew got a head start on this one. -Prof. Wren

Note: Half of the testing area walls are purple and the other half of the walls are smeared with D-21392's remains. The cleanup crew will have a headstart on the job because the two of you will be doing most of it. - Veritas

Test 914-0842
Name: Researcher Ydyn
Date: 03/06/2019
Total items: One First Alert smoke detector and one Casio watch.

Input: Output above.
Setting: Coarse
Output: Small piles of individual elements, similar to above.

Input: Output above.
Setting: Fine
Output: One small electric desk decoration, uncolored. Described as "very unappealing".

Input: Output above.
Setting: Fine
Output: One TASER disguised as a desk toy, seemingly designed to encourage contact at the metallic tips. It is possible to adjust shock voltage from 10 to 10,000 volts via a hidden dial. Notably, the taser has no significant electrical storage, making long-term use impractical.

Test 914-0843
Name: Security Officer Deegan
Date: 03/06/2019
Items: Three Foundation-issue M40 sniper rifles, currently in unserviceable condition.

Note: Eh, these things were destined for the smelter anyway. This thing's made some pretty crazy weapons out of less before. -Deegan

Input: 1 rifle.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 sniper rifle, in a style similar to a Kalashnikov Dragunov rifle. Scope now zooms to 3x prior distance. Later firing range testing confirms rifle meets Foundation accuracy requirements.

Input: 1 rifle.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 M40 sniper rifle, green in color with a rainbow coloration on the stock. Persons viewed through the scope are perceived as being dressed as circus clowns. Later firing range testing reveals the weapon shoots projectiles at barely sufficient speeds to exit the barrel before falling to the ground, while emitting a loud "honk" upon firing.

Input: 1 rifle.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 M40 sniper rifle, cobalt blue in color. A small green spherical alien sticking its tongue out, identified as being from the cover of the Douglas Adams novel "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," is seen on the stock. The words "Don't Panic" are printed on the scope. Later firing range testing revealed that aside from working perfectly normal, the rifle possesses an anomalous effect wherein anyone looking through the scope experiences a powerful sense of calm, slowing their heart rate by upwards of 27%.

Note: This may just be the best damned sniper rifle on the planet. Thanks a bunch for letting me come back here, Dr. Veritas. We'll keep these two. You guys can keep the clown rifle. -Deegan

Note: I just got back, he actually attempted to improve weaponry again? I give it a few weeks until one of those guns maims something horrible, probably the user. Speaking from experience. - Veritas

Test 914-0844
Name: Dr. Hort
Date: 03/06/2019
Total items: One 3kg block of dried maple wood, one 0.25Kg block of recently cut maple wood, one maple seed.

Input: 3kg of maple wood.
Setting: Fine
Output: One sculpture of a Canadian soldier. It has proven to be sentient, and will shoot wooden projectiles at anyone who doesn't behave politely in its surroundings.

Input: 0.25kg of recently cut maple wood.
Setting: Fine
Output: One small sculpture of baby Groot, from Guardians of the Galaxy 2. The sculpture is not sentient, although it is alive and behaves similarly to a normal plant. When growing, it will change appearance exactly like the character from the MCU series. It is currently in its “teenage Groot” form.

Input: One maple seed.
Setting: Fine
Output: The seedling has been separated from the seed shell and is now an extremely small but detailed model of a maple tree, while the seed shell is now an extremely small non-functional helicopter.

Note: I spent an incredible amount of time getting the permissions to perform the biological tests, and now 914 makes the least-dangerous and cutest outputs to ever exist. Great. - Dr. Hort

Test 914-0845
This test had been conducted with O5 approval, at a vote of 7-5, 1 abstaining. - O5 Council

Name: Assistant Researcher Erickson. Dr. Veritas supervising. Intern Lunar Assisting.
Date: 04/06/2019
Total Items: Five samples of a single cell life form, each contained in a glass petri-dish which has been chilled to prevent mitosis from occurring.

For this experiment, all non-modified samples are to be referred to as Strain-A. Before somebody throws a fit, we are using a harmless strain of Escherichia-Coli bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut. During this test, we will be analyzing how 914 can change the cellular structure of a life form.- Assistant Researcher Erickson

Input: 1 sample of Strain-A
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 modified sample, designated Strain-B. Strain B was similar to Strain-A in cellular structure, but showed a markedly different diet. When injected into test subject, Strain-B did not feed on undigested nutrients, but rather fed on the digestive enzymes produced by the intestinal tract.

Input: 1 sample of Strain-A
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 modified sample, designated Strain-C. Strain C showed extreme differences in cellular structure at first glance. Unfortunately, it appeared to require nutrients that were unavailable in the current environment and died. It displayed extremely fast decomposition upon death, and dissolved.

Input: 1 sample of Strain-A
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 modified sample, designated Strain-D. Strain-D appeared similar to Stain-A and Stain-B at first, but the similarities were superficial. Strain-D appears to feed off of electrical energy, and has an organelle with unknown use. On a hunch, Intern Lunar injected Strain-D into the brain of the test subject. Members of Strain-D immediately bonded to the subject's brain cells in the frontal lobe. Strain-D appears to feed on small amounts of the energy in the electrical currents that pass between brain cells.

After monitoring the subject for a ten day period, the subject appeared to develop extrasensory perception and could manipulate small objects without physically interacting with them. The subject often used it unconsciously. For instance, when the subject was reaching for something just out of reach, it would slide slightly closer. Subject is currently contained in a holding cell, further studies on Strain-D are pending. - Assistant Researcher Erickson

Input: 1 sample of Strain-A
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 modified sample, designated Strain-E. Strain E appears to have been modified to survive outside of the human body indefinitely. A hive like organism, it reproduced quickly under the correct conditions, forming colonies shaped as vine-like growths. Testing of Strain-E aborted when it was found that Strain-E was not only sentient, but extremely predatory towards anything smaller than the colony itself.

Input: 1 sample of Strain-A
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 unmodified sample. Instead, the petri-dish had been modified, with glass knobs on the side allowing "temperature control", "zoom", and "time control" through anomalous means. This allows the user to view the contained sample under multiple conditions, without use of a microscope. The petri-dish also appears to be able to sustain bacterial life indefinitely. The petri-dish does not open, however, making it ultimately useless.

Note: Veritas, can I keep the petri-dish as an office decoration? It may be useless, but its pretty cool. - Assistant Researcher Erickson

Note: Erickson, if that thing actually controls the flow of time in its interior, it takes one screwup to rapidly evolve something that can break out of the glass. Filed in anomalous storage. - Veritas

Test 914-0846
Name: Doctor Starr
Date: 04/06/2019
Total Items: Five rolls of three meter long five cm medical gauze (Tape Variety)

Note: Testing with the painkillers has gotten both too dangerous and too ambitious to continue hoping for a beneficial product. To anyone that wants, you can use the reverse-engineered pills in your own testing should the need arise. Today’s test will be the start of a series of tests with multiple basic medical supplies. Any testable solution found today will be used on D-Class with small incisions on the top of the left forearm. -Doctor Starr

Input: One roll of gauze
Setting: Rough
Output: A smoking pile of ripped up linen with molten adhesive drenched on top.

Note: As expected, the rough category lit the input of my test on fire. I wonder if there is a reason burning is the rough category for me. -Doctor Starr

Input: One roll of gauze
Setting: Coarse
Output: A ball of silk stuck to the floor inside of the output booth which is completely covered with the adhesive.

Note: It took over two hours to find a janitorial staff and get the all of the adhesive off of the output booth. I would recommend a cart of cleaning supplies be left nearby the door to Research Cell 109-B to avoid these types of delays in the future. -Doctor Starr

Input: One roll of gauze
Setting: 1:1
Output: A stack of seventy-two 5 cm by 5 cm gauze bandages labeled “914 Brand Bandages” on the top. No anomalous effects have been found and they are as effective as the bandages used by our staff. Delivered to Facility 23's section in the Medical Ward Placed in anomalous storage until any latent effects are confirmed or disproved by order of Dr. Veritas.

Input: One roll of gauze
Setting: Fine
Output: Similar looking gauze with anomalous property of boosting patients natural healing rate, closing the wound, even those that would normally scar, without scabbing within twenty minutes of the application of the gauze. The energy and nutritional requirements in the accelerated healing are increased by 2000%. As such, side effects are malnutrition, diarrhea, dehydration, poor bowel and bladder control, fever and fatigue, making it impractical for field use. Side effects wear off after wound is treated and gauze is removed.

Input: One roll of gauze
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Same gauze but now the color blue. Gauze works exactly the same as the input with no positive or negative anomalous effects. Upon Doctor Starr entering the room to retrieve the output, the gauze lifted from the D-54386 hands and swiftly hovered towards Doctor Starr, where it stopped six cm above the left shoulder blade. If the output enters a two meter radius of an open wound it applies the exact amount of gauze required to cover the wound(s) before cutting itself and returning to the shoulder automatically. Output can be resupplied by placing in contact with more of the gauze used with the input, with a maximum of five meters in length.

Note: I personally don’t have any issues with my new companion seeing as it can make my job a little easier. Veritas, would it be possible keeping it with me in case a medical emergency were to occur somewhere a medical kit might be unavailable? -Doctor Starr

Note: You know the drill, Starr. Keep it, but it's your career on the line if that thing strangles a colleague two weeks in. - Veritas

Test 914-0850
Name: Researcher Ija Rasclon
Date: 05/06/2019
Total Items: 3 small capacitors (charged)

Note: Using capacitors because: A) the fast discharge they generate may create interesting results with 914, and B) they contain far less energy than batteries, and so will (hopefully) be a safe electrical component to test while charged. Also, I'm back. Finished the paperwork to move up to a full researcher. -Rasclon

Input: 1 capacitor
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 capacitor, of a different brand. Notably, the new brand uses a rubber casing with less surface area than the input brand, so the casing is thicker than normal. Similar changes occurred with discrepancies in the amount of other component materials.

Input: 1 capacitor
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 capacitor, which released its charge via a spark between the exposed terminals. It seems the capacitor releases its charge at a much higher voltage, and accordingly lower amperage, than the input. When recharged, similar event occurred. Placed in anomalous storage.

Input: 1 capacitor
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 capacitor, seemingly unchanged. No anomalous properties observed throughout 8 hours of interaction and testing. Increasing fear observed in present researchers throughout the testing was determined not to be a memetic effect.

Note: I'm requesting for this to be stored in top security anomalous item containment. -Rasclon

Note: We still don't know what the refinement did. Until we find out, it has been stored in a heavy containment locker, lined with lead. Anomalous Materials can take a look at it if they feel like it, but I recommend doing so with extreme caution. I trust 914 even less when refinements aren't immediately obvious. - Veritas

Test 914-0851
Name: Researcher Graymont
Date: 05/06/2019
Input: Various fossils

Note: I saw an accidental fossil extraction quite a ways back in the logs, so I want to see if this is able to be reproduced. - Graymont

Input: One small fossil of a seashell embedded in sedimentary rock
Setting: Course
Output: Perfectly extracted fossil with the rock next to it.

Note: It worked swimmingly, I will now move on to a much more valuable fossil. - Graymont

Input: 10 kilogram fossil of a species that is very rarely fossilized. Extraction through normal methods deemed too difficult and could damage the fossil
Setting: Course
Output: One 3 kilogram cube of fossilized bone. One 7 Kilogram of sedimentary rock.

Note: That was the only fossil of the creature we had. Should have known better. - Graymont

Input: One piece of paper with the religious symbol for the hanged king. One pencil.
Setting: Fine
Output: One piece of paper. A large hole has been worn in the center with the eraser end of the pencil. A cityscape is portrayed as tilting towards the hole, as if being sucked in. One pencil.

Input: One piece of paper with the logo for The Factory. One pencil.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One well made drawing of a large factory floor. A small crowd of people sit huddled on one side of the room, staring towards something just out of view. Viewers of the item express a feeling of helplessness. One pencil.

Input: One photo of the staff of Site-19 facility-23. The building is visible in the background.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One photo of the staff of Site-19 facility-23. Several researchers have been removed from the sketch, and several strange apparitions are in their place. Most of the security staff are missing from the picture, and Dr. Veritas appears to be concerned. A large portion of the facility has collapsed.

Note: This is… unnerving. - Assistant Researcher Erickson

Test 914-0854
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 07/06/2019
Total items: One flag of Georgia (country), 2m by 3m

Input: One flag of Georgia
Setting: Fine
Output: One flag of Sakartvelo as it was from 1991 to 2004, 1.732m by 3.464m. Viewers are compelled to refer the country by its Kartvelian name, and will view former Soviet Union leader Josef Stalin positively. This effect persists for exactly 2004 minutes.

Test 914-0855
Name: Researcher Qaniz
Date: 10/06/2019
Total Items: One Mattel brand "Magic 8-Ball" Toy

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A black shot glass filled with blue alcoholic liquid, presumably the liquid inside the Magic 8-Ball

Addendum: A D-Class personnel was instructed to drink the mentioned liquid. After approximately 3 hours of severe nausea and fever, subject was rendered unconscious for an hour. Upon regaining consciousness, subject had ceased all motor functions and could only communicate and answer questions using the Magic 8-Ball's preset answers. Awaiting further questioning.

Note: The poor D-Class is basically brain dead now, but can't deny my amazement at the results. Maybe he's gained predictive abilities? Will question the subject once he's in a more stable state. -Qaniz

Test 914-0856
Name: Dr. O'Connor
Date: 11/06/2019
Total Items: Five King James Version Christian Bibles, (Following items not originally listed; added after 4th experiment) 10g 24 carat gold, 8 bottles acrylic paint (6 primary colors, black, and white), approximately 25g of small precious gemstones including diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, bottle of white glue

Input: 1 KJV Bible
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of ash

Note: Security Personnel 2698, was a volunteer firefighter before joining the Foundation, claims that the pile smelled of some kind of liquid accelerant (e.g., gasoline). Mass spectroscopy of the output reveals only wood ash and carbonized ink compounds.

Input: 1 KJV Bible
Setting: Coarse
Output: a pile of shredded paper and a small black puddle of ink

Input: 1 KJV Bible
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 Bible, New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) translation

Input: 1 KJV Bible
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 Bible, with a relatively plain cover showing only the word "Bible." Contents are in fine calligraphy, seemingly handwritten. Scripture text does not match any known published version or translation.

Note: Determined to be non-anomalous, placed in site library for public access.

Note: This gives me an idea. I'm going to get some more supplies. - O'Connor

Input: 1 KJV Bible, 10g 24 carat gold, 8 bottles acrylic paint (6 primary colors, black, and white), approximately 25g of small precious gemstones including diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, bottle of white glue
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A papier-mâché sculpture. Shape is abstract, and no clear subject matter has been determined. Upper half of sculpture is vibrantly painted with apparently random patterns, studded with gemstones; lower half covered with gold leaf.

Note: I was hoping for an illuminated Bible. I'm still going to keep the sculpture though. - O'Connor

Note: Keep it, but let me know if that thing starts announcing rapture, ragnarok, or any other apocalyptic event. Not sure if we should respond to it, but Hackett will be cross with me if the world was ending and I didn't tell him. - Veritas

This test has been conducted with O5 approval, at a vote of 8-3, 2 abstaining. Following examination of Strain-D, we have deemed it acceptable for bacterial testing to continue. - O5 Council

Test 914-0857
Name: Assistant Researcher Erickson. Dr. Veritas supervising. Intern Lunar Assisting.
Date: 11/06/2019
Total Items: 3 samples of a single cell life form, each contained in a glass petri-dish which has been chilled to prevent mitosis from occurring.

As before, we will be using the harmless strain of Escherichia-Coli. I have high hopes for this direction of testing. - Assistant Researcher Erickson

Input: 1 sample of Strain-A
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 modified sample, designated Strain-F. Strain F appears to have several modified organelles, and it's body structure is more streamlined. DNA analysis revealed that [Level 4 Clearance Required]. Strain F is sapient. It has proven to build settlements using debris in the intestinal tract, and individual members have exhibited the ability to engage in trade with separate colonies. A barter system seems to be in place. One molecule of a strong material is worth 2-3 molecules of a weaker material.

I could write a five hundred page book on this and still not understand them. Pending SCP classification. - Assistant Researcher Erickson

Input: One sample of Strain-A
Setting: Fine
Output: One modified sample, designated Strain-G. Strain-G has proven resilient to extreme changes in temperature. Strain-G appears to have developed a modified cell wall, capable of providing extreme control of internal temperature. DNA studies have begun to isolate the responsible gene pair.

Note: If we can isolate the correct gene, we might be able to adapt humans to more extreme weather and temperature conditions. Imagine walking around Antarctica in nothing but shorts and a T-shirt. It may now be possible! - Assistant Researcher Erickson.

Input: One sample of Strain-A
Setting: Fine
Output: One modified sample, designated Strain-H. Strain-H appeared to be completely similar to Strain-A. However, when put into an enviroment containing other single cell organisms, it showed the ability to move towards other organisms, attach itself to them, and copy pieces of their genetic makeup. The next generation would always have these additional genetic attributes implemented in some way beneficial to the organism.

Note: To create a brief synopsis of this organism: Using this ability, no environment can kill the organism because it steals the genetic material of organisms that can survive in that environment. This is the most perfect organism I have ever seen. It will probably outlast even the tardigrade. That said, this could be extremely dangerous if it comes into contact with any of the anomalous diseases contained by the Foundation. Formally requesting permission to neutralize Strain-H. I believe by quickly switching between hot and cold environments, multiple times, we can terminate it.- Assistant Researcher Erickson.

Note: Result terminated using the method above. Remains kept in cold storage as a precaution. - Veritas

Test 914-0858
Name: Dr Clocks
Date: 09/06/2019
Total Items: Three sets of short stories written by H.P Lovecraft

Input: One set of Lovecraftian stories
Setting: 1:1
Output: One altered set of stories written by Lovecraft. Writing now is more up to date, events in the book take place in more modern areas and times and leading characters are more varied with characters ranging from all sorts of backgrounds and ethnicities.

Input: One set of Lovecraftian stories
Setting: Fine
Output: One stack of SCP files, each with clearance level 3. Confiscated by Dr. Veritas.

Note: It is funny to see what 914 did here. Then again, most of these monsters that we keep locked up could definitely work in some Cosmic Horror stories. -Dr Clocks

Input: One set of Lovecraftian stories
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One hardback covered book. The front cover of said book depicts a language currently unknown in origin. Before proper analysis was taken into place, Dr Clocks almost instinctively removed the book from the testing area and placed it into the incinerator.

Note: Look we all how this would have ended. We've all read Lovecraft and we know exactly what will happen when we read it. -Dr Clocks

Note: Good call. - Veritas

Test 914-0859
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 10/06/2019
Total Items: 3 mountain bikes, heavily damaged.

Note: Word to the wise, make sure you're on the beginner course when trying mountain biking for the first time. They call the one a couple of my friends and I wound up on "Dead Man's Plummet" for good reason, it seems. These things are pretty much useless now, so I figured we may as well see what 914 can do with them, maybe get them back in working order. -Prof. Wren

Input: 1 bike.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A scale model of Kilimanjaro made out of rubber, plastic, and metal.

Input: 1 bike.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A scale model of Denali National Park made out of rubber, plastic, and metal.

Input: 1 bike.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A scale model of the Himalayas made out of rubber, plastic, and metal.

Note: Turning mountain bikes into bike mountains…not sure if this is profound or just silly, but I have to admit there's a certain artistic quality to these. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0860
Name: Dr. Hort
Date: 10/06/2019
Total Items: 5 drawings of various characters from The Chronicles of Narnia.

Note: I finished the books and got inspired, so I drew these. I hope 914 doesn’t just make origami feces as it did with some people’s poetry and drawings. - Dr. Hort.

Input: One drawing of Aslan.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One paper copy of the Shroud of Turin.

Input: One drawing of Drigory and Polly.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One drawing of Adam and Eve.

Input: One drawing Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, kings and queens of Narnia.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One drawing of four children walking through street. Architecture similar to London around 1943.

Input: One drawing of Shasta.

Output: One drawing of Corin, prince of Archenland.

Input: One drawing of Caspian, prince of Narnia.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One drawing of Rilian, the son of Caspian.

Test 914-0861
Name: Researcher Jane Cho
Date: 11/06/2019
Total Items: 5 1 glass beaker containing 500mL of 1M phosphoric acid in aqueous solution, with ~3% of the phosphorus being phosphorus-32.

Note: Phosphorus-32 is a radioactive isotope of phosphorus which decays into sulfur-32 via beta decay. Its half-life is 14.29 days, making it useful for this test

Note: I’m deviating from my regular throwing-rocks-into-914 routine because this is something I wanted to try for weeks.

Note: Apparently, when 914 refines things, it can rearrange individual nuclei and electrons easily, but it never touches the insides of nuclei.

Note: This means that, by putting radioactive isotopes into 914, the nuclei can be tracked in space to check for spatial anomalies, and also be radiometrically dated to check for temporal anomalies. This is exciting. - Jane Cho

Input: Above
Setting: Rough
Output: Multiple glass shards in a puddle of water. The molecules of phosphoric acid appears to have been mixed with the air and therefore dissipated upon opening the output booth. The shards are arranged to create a cognitohazardous symbol that causes viewers to permanently develop an intense irrational fear of the concept of radioactivity. This effect cannot be reversed by any known means.

Note: Sometimes, I just wonder if anything we do here matters. - Jane Cho

Test 914-0862
Name: Researcher Graymont
Date: 11/06/2019
Input: One small hydraulic press measured to be 10kg, 2 liters of hydraulic fluid, steel measuring to weigh 10kg

Note: I have plans for future tests in similar style; an item with raw materials for 914 to use as it chooses. - Graymont

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Fine
Output: Hydraulic cannon weighing 15kg. Fires a 5kg projectile at 15 meters per second.

Note: Upon opening the output booth, the cannon launched a 5 kg rod directly at Researcher Graymont's chest. He attempted to dodge and managed to only have his right ribcage damaged with several ribs broken. Expected full recovery in approximately a week.

This test has been conducted with O5 approval, at a vote of 9-1, 3 abstaining. Following examination of Strain-G, we have deemed it acceptable, and potentially beneficial, for bacterial testing to continue. - O5 Council

Test 914-0863
Name: Assistant Researcher Erickson. Dr. Veritas supervising. Intern Lunar and D-80397 assisting.
Date: 13/06/2019
Total Items: 2 samples of a single cell life form, each contained in a glass petri-dish which has been chilled to prevent mitosis from occurring.

Note: Due to 914s penchant for creating more lethal results the more something is tested, we have equipped a Class-D and myself with hazmat gear. He will be handling the outputs until it is determined that they are safe for human contact. A portable decon station has been set up inside the testing chamber. -Assistant Researcher Erickson

Input: One sample of Strain-A
Setting: Fine
Output: One modified sample, designated Strain-I. Strain-I is completely similar to Strain-A on the cellular level, but it appears to be sterile. It cannot reproduce, and indeed appears incapable of aging, making it functionally immortal. However, the organism was still susceptible to death from external sources.

Note: Unfortunate. That organism could have been the solution to overpopulation.- Assistant Researcher Erickson.

Input: One sample of Strain-A
Setting: Fine
Output: One modified sample, designated Strain-J. Properties not fully known. The Class-D assisting tripped and shattered the petri-dish, freeing the organism that was inside. Bacteria ate organic material and polymer, and excreted a glass-like filament. Chamber flooded with hydrogen peroxide, and drained 5 minutes later. Assistant Researcher Erickson, who was inside the chamber, and D-80396 were retrieved with some difficulty.
Testing area was flooded with Hydrogen Peroxide, effectively neutralizing the threat, and drained 5 minutes later. SCP-914 suffered no structural damage from the result and cleanup.

Note: Poor bastard. Whatever it was, it ate through his suit in seconds. Half a minute after he dropped the damn thing, he was a sculpture sitting in a puddle of blood. I think that was the bacterial equivalent of a piranha. I may need to take a Class-A amnestic, because that was brutal. - Dr. Sheath

Note: So. I checked him over. Looked for any kind of response indicating he was still alive. He is not. If anyone wants a life size glass figurine of Assistant Researcher Erickson, stop by my office. - Medical Officer Matthews

Note: What bothers me is that a clear hazmat suit was what replaced him in that staff picture. -Intern Lunar.

Note: By unanimous decision, bacterial testing of SCP-914 has been temporarily discontinued, until a another suitable researcher is available for assignment. The loss of Assistant Researcher Erickson is sad, but the insight was worth it. -O5 Council

Note: Hackett, I'm formally requesting permission to forward all complaints from the janitorial and anomalous cleanup team to O5 command. My inbox is being bombarded right now. - Veritas

Note: Send them to me, Lucius. I'll let them know that bacterial testing is suspended. - Director Hackett

Test 914-0864
Name: Doctor Mayo
Date: 13/06/2019
Total items: Five Huawei branded smart watches and one post-it note reading "Hello 914. My name is Doctor Mayo, how do you do?".

Note: Good morning everyone, please call me Mayo. I've been following the logs and have decided to start my own series of attempts to further explore 914's abilities and functions. - Doctor Mayo

Input: The aforementioned Post-it note.
Setting: 1:1
Output: The note now shows a square with an arrow pointing into a small sketch of the input booth of 914 and a triangle coming out of the output booth.

Note: Okay then, honestly not too sure what i was expecting there. Right, time to begin. - Doctor Mayo

Input: One Huawei branded smart watch.
Setting: Rough
Output: A mound of partially melted plastic, metal and glass. The fumes released once the output booth was opened were incredibly unpleasant.

Input: One Huawei branded smart watch.
Setting: Course
Output: Three piles, one of crushed glass, plastic and metal filaments.

Input: One Huawei branded smart watch.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Sony branded smart watch.

Note: I have to agree with 914 on this, i own both models and have to say they really are like for like. - Doctor Mayo

Input: One Huawei branded smart watch.
Setting: Fine
Output: One "Thales" branded smart watch. Upon wearing the device a mild electric shock is experienced when receiving a notification. The functionality of the device seems unchanged. All of the inputs on the screen are in old Latin and cannot be changed.

Note: Thales being one of the first credited researchers into electricity, the watch being in Latin and producing mild shocks must be related. Actually hurts quite a bit though. I'm going to put a note on this before putting into storage. - Doctor Mayo

Input: One Huawei branded smart watch.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One "Huawei" branded "smart observer", it is noted the branding for Huawei is now in simplified Chinese "华为". Upon the output booth being opened the device leaped out onto the leg of Doctor Mayo and began to climb up until it reached his shoulder. Once perched it began to "observe". focused on different areas of the room and shout in Chinese. The phrases it shouted roughly translated as "Not Splendid" when observing the reinforced shield and "Splendid" when observing 914's input booth.

Output: A large octahedral diamond crystal, with three small unlabeled graphite reels embedded onto one side. The words “COMPLYTESPECTRYMRAYNBOWDYAMOND”(sic) is engraved onto the opposite side. Turning the reels change the color of the crystal. Each reel appears to correspond to the hue, saturation, and absorbance value of the crystal, respectively.

Input: 20g blue-gray Type IIb diamond
Setting: 1:1
Output: 20g dark yellow Type IIb diamond. The origin of the yellow color could not be determined.

Input: 20g blue-gray Type IIb diamond
Setting: Fine
Output: A small diamond sphere that changes color depending on the strength of the electrical field in its immediate surroundings. Stronger electrical fields cause its color to turn blue, while weaker electric fields cause its color to turn red.

Test 914-0866
Name: Dr. Silver
Date: 17/06/2019
Total Items: A stainless steel spoon, one can of Darkside Cola (dispensed by SCP-261), a blueprint for a handgun.

Input: One can of Darkside Cola.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One bottle of Darkside Orange Soda. Similar to Darkside Cola, when the bottle was opened, the liquid inside immediately turned black. Tasted like slightly spicy orange soda.

Note: Not as good as the cola. -Dr. Silver

Input: A blueprint for a handgun.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A blueprint for a chainsaw cannon. After evaluation by Site Security Chief, it was determined that the design was extremely unpractical and more hazardous to the user than the target.

Test 914-0867
Name: Assistant Researcher Jack Dickie, D-51215, D-54212
Date: 17/06/2019
Total Items: One British Pound coin, no longer in circulation. One bag of marbles, exactly 25 marbles inside.

Input: One British Pound coin
Setting: Fine
Output: The coin is notably thinner and wider, with the words Heads and Tails stamped into the coin. D-51215 was ordered to flip the coin, which landed on its edge. D-51215 was ordered to make a call and try again. The coin continued to land on its edge, result moved to anomalous storage.

Input: One bag of marbles
Setting: 1:1
Output: One single glass marble is inside the bag. This single marble is notably heavier, and the colours inside it change depending on what angle the person is viewing it from. D-51215 was instructed to play a game of marbles with D-54212. The new marble was flicked lightly at a cluster of marbles, causing them to fly out of bounds and shatter against the walls of the testing chamber. D-51215's thumb was burnt by the marble during this test. A second test, with a padded vest and padded gloves provided to both D-Class was performed. The marble was propelled harder, and result in the marbles hit, to fly out of the circle at lethal velocity, killing D-54212 and shattering D-51215's thumb.

Note: It seems like the marble has the mass of all the marbles, and increases the kinetic energy used to flick it, transferring it to other marbles. - AR Dickie

Test 914-0868
Name: Researcher Maksymilian Ostro
Date: 17/06/2019
Total Items: Two decks of Magic the Gathering cards (60 cards per deck), 4 six sided dice, Instruction manual for MTG. 5 cards for the singular card test.

Pre-experiment Note: 914 has shown an ability to understand physical games like chess or Jenga. Researcher Ash tested it on games with more complex rules. This experiment is to test the limits of its understanding in games. -Researcher Maksymilian

Input: Two six sided dice thrown in the chamber with 5 and 4 on their upside and two gently placed dice.
Setting: 1:1
Output: Thrown dice now both have 1 on their upside and the gently placed ones have 6.

Input: Two aforementioned decks one on the far side, the other on the opposite side near the input door.
Setting: 1:1
Output: Both decks are shuffled and lives set to 20. Far side has seven cards in front.

Input: Two aforementioned decks. The deck near has 7 cards taken out.
Setting: 1:1
Output: The far deck has 6 different cards.

Input: Two aforementioned decks.
Setting: 1:1
Output: The Far deck has placed a land card and put their allowed cards on the battlefield.

[Logs 5-70 expunged for brevity]

Input: Two aforementioned decks. The close deck has used Blacker Lotus.
Setting: Rough
Output: The blacker lotus card has been torn to pieces and mana added to the pool.

[logs 72-128 expunged for brevity]

Note: Let's see how it reacts to a singular card.-Researcher Maksymilian

Input: One black lotus from the near side deck
Setting: Very fine
Output: One card called "The blackest of black lotuses" Its description reads" ''Get infinite mana of every color to your mana pool, play any cards you like how much you like afterwards, eat this card and every card in one kilometer radius. The item has shown no anomalous properties This item has an anomalous property that manifests if the user has played the card. When this occurs, the user is forced to carry out the description.

Input: Alhammarret's Archive card
Setting: Fine
Output: The card now details personal thoughts and details of Researcher Maksymilian the person that is watching it. If there are multiple people watching it, the person observing it will only see their own version

Note: Researcher Maksymilian was admitted to amnestics bay but then released when it was discovered only Dr. Veritas could see [REDACTED] -Dr. ████

Input: A Permafrost Trap card, a Time Stop card and a Timebomb card

Note: I'll test it for multiple cards.-Researcher Maksymilian

Setting: Very fine
Output: One card that reads "Play it, and stop time in the room you are in permanently after 5 seconds."

Note: Stored in Anomalous Storage, well presuming its anomalous but I'm not playing it to find out. -Researcher Maksymilian.

Test 914-0869
Name: Junior Researcher Jimson
Date: 17/06/2019
Input: One typed note reading "Hello, 914. I have been recently assigned to work with you. I am interested in us working together as effectively as possible."

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Fine
Output: A typed, one-page brochure entitled "How to effectively work with 914". Aside from the title and some generic black-and-white graphics, the brochure is blank. A cognitohazardous effect when viewing the output causes the viewer to have the overwhelming urge to find and speak at length to MT Johnson on the subject of the intricacies and good strategies of equipment repair. Output incinerated and JR Jimson along with two security guards were administered amnestics after being escorted to the infirmary by a very irritated-looking MT Johnson.

Note: Aside from the cognitohazard and being administered amnestics on my first test at this facility, I'd say this first test went as well as it could. On a related note, my future tests in this series will be run on settings no higher than 1:1; less chance of producing anomalous effects that way. - JR Jimson

Test 914-0870
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 17/06/2019
Total Items: 5 NATO .762 shell casings, previously fired.

Note: Not gonna lie, I won't be the least bit surprised if 914 somehow makes one of these a live round again. - Prof. Wren

Input: One shell casing.
Setting: Rough
Output: A small pile of shredded metal fragments.

Input: One shell casing.
Setting: Coarse
Output: One smaller shell casing made entirely of copper, another made entirely of zinc.

Input: One shell casing.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A small brass conch.

Note: A shell for a shell. Huh. -Prof. Wren

Input: One shell casing.
Setting: Fine
Output: An empty shell casing, apparently factory-new. Shell emits a loud "BANG" upon being touched, or dropped, on its "firing cap" side; effect takes 76.2 seconds to "recharge" via unknown means before repeating.

Input: One shell casing.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A 1/8192 scale model M1A2 Abrams Tank made entirely out of copper. Tank moved autonomously and "fired" on D-class in testing area, launching small, highly-pressurized air bursts at 7.62-second intervals. After 3 shots, D-class destroyed the tank by stomping on it.

Note: Dang. I was kinda liking that thing. Should probably get rid of the self-firing shell, though…someone's bound to find a way to get themselves, and/or someone else, killed with it otherwise. - Prof. Wren

Test 914-0871
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 17/06/2019
Total Items: A map of Greece, dated 1991; an electoral map of Italy in the 2019 European Parliament Election.

Input: Maps
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A map labelled "60th Anniversary of the Partition of Greece and Collaborationist Italy after the Olympian War, 1942". The map, dated 2002, shows Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Turkey annexing all of Greece north of Mount Olympus; and France, Austria, Switzerland and Yugoslavia annexing northern Italy and Sardinia. Sicily is noted as a British Trust Territory, while nuclear strikes are shown in Athens, Patras, and Mount Olympus. An extradimensional territory, denoted as "Olympus (administered by the Hellenic Olympians)" is also shown as being occupied by the United Kingdom, France, Austria, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Turkey. Viewing the map induces extreme hatred against Hellenistic culture, and polytheism in general. Administration of Class-B amnestics reverses the effects.

Input: The above result
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Two items:
1. The fourth chapter (titled "Turkish Attempts at Protection") of a book titled "Understanding Bulgarian Nationalism: Olympian-Greek Occupation and Genocide 1936-1942". Viewing this causes the viewer to be fluent in Greek, Bulgarian, and Turkish for exactly 1939 hours.
2. A map of Bulgaria, dated 1994, from the same world as the previous result. Notably, a Greek Autonomous Region was present, encompassing our world's equivalent of Thessaloniki, Chalkidiki, and Mount Athos Regional Units; whilst Targovishte, Razgrad, Shumen, and Silistra Provinces are grouped under a Turkish Autonomous Region. Kardzhali Province, along with Rhodope and Evros in Greece, were apparently ceded to Turkey. Viewing this has a 40% likelihood of causing the viewer to be obsessed with Bulgarian Nationalism.

Date: 17/06/2019
Total Items: Three copies of Guitar Hero for the Playstation 2, Three PS2 guitar controllers.

Note: I was never any good at these games. -Prof. Wren

Input: One game and controller.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One copy of Ukulele Hero for the Playstation 2, One PS2 ukulele controller. Game is not known to actually exist. Game functions similarly to original input, with in-game elements and song selections having a more "tropical" theme to them.

Input: One game and controller.
Setting: Fine
Output: The guitar controller with the game disc embedded in it label-side down. PS2 controller socket has been converted to a standard USB-C socket; plugging the unit into a USB port causes the disc to project a holographic image of the game as it would normally appear on a 64-inch widescreen television. Game functions normally while powered.

Input: One game and controller.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A 2:3-scale Gibson Les Paul guitar, with a body composed of the controller's materials and strings made out of the disc. Holding the guitar causes a memetic effect wherein the holder feels compelled to play their favorite rock song on it; D-class doing initial test suffered numerous fingertip lacerations while trying to play Ozzy Osbourne's "Crazy Train." Memetic effect concludes with a compulsion to smash the instrument on the floor upon song's completion. Instrument reassembles itself over a period of Four minutes.

Note: Those first two could probably go to the break room, but I think it might be best to put that last one in the incinerator. On top of the severe finger trauma, that thing just sounded God-awful to a degree that I don't think we can blame on D-33874C's skills, or lack thereof. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0873
Name: Doctor Mayo, D-46931
Date: 18/06/2019
Total Items: Five pairs of Enchroma colour blind glasses.

Note: Good day, all. My last test seemed to result in some play on words in the output results from 914, so seeing if I get the same with a few duplicate pairs of the glasses that I personally use. - Doctor Mayo

Input: One pair of Enchroma colour blind glasses.
Setting: Rough
Output: Broken glass and plastic fragments.

Input: One pair of Enchroma colour blind glasses.
Setting: Coarse
Output: A single pile of plastic, the broken glass was in the middle of the pile.

Input: One pair of Enchroma colour blind glasses.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One pair of Pilestone colour blind glasses.

Input: One pair of Enchroma colour blind glasses.
Setting: Fine
Output: A blind with the slats made out of very thin pieces of glass. When viewed at different angles, these pieces change colour. The plastic in the glasses has been reformed into a kind of flexible string-like structure, holding the blind together.

Note: Well, that is a pretty useless blind considering it can been seen through but it certainly makes for a nice light show. Requesting to keep this in the office. As for the next test, I have learned my lesson and the very fine test will be conducted by D-46931. - Doctor Mayo

Input: One pair of Enchroma colour blind glasses.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One pair of unmodified colour blind glasses colour absorbing glasses. When D-46931 put on the glasses and looked at the control colour test sheets, they were drained of all hue instantly, turning completely black.

Well, I was expecting it to cause colour blindness, not create some kind of visual stimulation device. This test is inconclusive as far as the ''play on words'' theory. My appreciation to the security team in restraining D-46931 when they were asked to hand back the glasses. Just a shame my shirt was drained; it was one of my favorites. - Doctor Mayo

Test 914-0874
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 18/06/2019
Total Items: 15 Bic ball-point pens

Note: I am not doing this just to clear out space in my desk. That is merely a side benefit. -Prof. Wren

Input: 5 pens.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A thin A4-sized sheet of plastic with an "inverted" image of the Bic logo, with ink everywhere except where the logo is, drawn on it.

Input: 5 pens.
Setting: Fine
Output: A plastic flintlock-style pistol. Weapon discharges a hollow, 1.2954cm diameter ink ball at a muzzle velocity of approximately 128m/s. Ink splatters harmlessly on impact. Weapon ran out of ink after 52 shots.

Note: The size and velocity are consistent with black powder muskets. The total number of shots is consistent with the amount of ink 5 pens would hold as well. Interesting. -Prof. Wren

Input: 5 pens.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 oversized Bic ballpoint pen. Total mass and ink content is consistent with the 5 inputs. Tip of pen is standard size and functions normally.

Note: Okay, I'm not buying this, 914. There's no way the "play God at your own peril" setting only spits out a novelty joke pen. Requesting this thing be examined more thoroughly for any kind of anomalous properties. -Prof. Wren

Note: As of 7 hours after being initially produced by SCP-914, the pen has shown no anomalous properties, even when drained of ink and fully dismantled.

Test 914-0875
Name: Junior Researcher Jimson
Date: 20/06/2019
Total Items: One 1 liter bottle of [REDACTED] brand gear oil, one handwritten note that reads "Have a quart of oil on me", one pencil.

Input: Above mentioned items
Setting: 1:1
Output: Unchanged bottle of oil. The original bottle of gear oil, seemingly unchanged, one pencil, and one handwritten note that reads "Halve a quart of oil on you". Upon opening the bottle of oil to inspect the contents for any changes, approximately half of the contents of said bottle was sprayed precisely onto Junior Researcher Jimson. No injuries were sustained. Further analysis of the remaining contents reveals no anomalous properties and that the amount sprayed out totals exactly one half quart.

Note: "Have a quart" became "Halve a quart"? Is 914 making a pun or does 1:1 now also transform words into homophones? Regardless, I'd like to officially request tomorrow off so I can thoroughly scrub every inch of me. Most of it sprayed on my face, so I'm lucky I wear glasses but I'm going to be tasting that awful stuff for weeks. -JR Jimson

Test 914-0876
Name: Intern Snevets
Date: 20/06/2019
Total Items: Five large bins of assorted basic electronics components

Note: Just received a transfer order last night; seems I’ve been reassigned here. I look forward to working with you all. - Intern Snevets

Input: One bin
Setting: Coarse
Output: Cubes of various metals, piles of plastic pellets and ceramic component casings, powdered dyes, a ball bearing made of enamel, several drops of electrolyte gel, and a very small silicon crystal.

I looked over some of the older testing logs this morning. It seems a bit strange that each material is in a different form. - Intern Snevets

Input: One bin
Setting: 1:1
Output: A bin of basic clockwork parts. Notably, several parts are made out of materials that cause them to not function properly. (e.g. springs made of ceramic)

Input: One bin
Setting: Fine
Output: A bin of components shaped like puzzle pieces. The pieces are constructed in a manner that allows any piece to be connected to any other piece.

Input: One bin
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Unchanged A bin of parts which perfectly match theoretical values and produce no waste heat. Of special interest are the modified diodes and resistors: current flowing through the diodes in the reverse direction is returned out the cathode, rather than converted to heat, and the resistors are marked with a black tolerance band (according to standard resistor color code, black has no meaning as a tolerance band) which is invariably identified as denoting a tolerance of 0%.

Note: Sending the ‘perfect’ components for possible reverse-engineering. Let’s see if we can make more. - Intern Snevets

Input: One bin
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small metal figure, wielding a ceramic tantō and dressed in a kimono made of plastic film. Object animated briefly and proceeded to commit seppuku, bleeding electrolyte.

Note: I'm keeping the tantō - Intern Snevets

Note: No, you're not. - Veritas

Test 914-0877
Name: Junior Researcher Emmerson
Date: 21/06/2019
Total Items: Three glass petri-dishes. Each contain one strand of Human DNA, taken from stem cells.

So, hi everybody. O5 command transferred me here for the specific purpose of bacterial testing. There will be some changes to the bacterial testing procedures. This test exists to set a baseline on how it can effect DNA itself. Security is oh high alert. - Junior Researcher Emmerson

Input: 1 glass petri-dish.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 glass petri-dish. 1 modified strand of human DNA. Several genetic markers are now present, notably a theoretical marker that is, for all intents and purposes, biologically impossible to achieve. Sample destroyed.

Input: 1 glass petri-dish.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 glass petri-dish. 1 modified strand. Notably, this strand contained no abnormalities or anomalies. Several markers for down syndrome were present.

Input: 1 glass petri-dish. 1 glass petri-dish containing human stem cells.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 mobile glass figurine. Humanoid in shape, and standing approximately 10 cm tall. Object contains several biological components, namely, human hair and eyes. Testing proved entity to be sapient. Entity is capable of communication through writing, and insists itself to be Assistant Researcher Erickson. Item currently resides in locker #128 of anomalous storage.

Test 914-0878
Name: Researcher Vesania
Date: 21/06/2019
Total Items: One Foundation-authored scientific paper, titled Introductory Pataphysics

Input: The above-mentioned paper
Setting: Fine
Output: A short story, titled Insanity’s Humanity. The story details the actions taken by Researcher Vesania on the day of this test, up to and including removal of the document. The end of the story details Vesania's feelings of anxiety and dread as she realizes the potential consequences of her coworkers reading the document, and she requests that the document be burned.

Note: Ignore that. I have nothing to hide, so I have nothing to fear. In fact, we should probably burn the document—in case it carries an infohazard, of course. -Researcher Vesania

Note: Confiscated by me and forwarded to Dr. Veritas's office. Evaluation pending. - Security Officer Sedna

Test 914-0879
Name: Researcher Laskenta; D-46931
Date: 21/06/2019
Total Items: Three standard "Facility 19-23" SCP Foundation PCs (without any data outside of the operating system)

Note: Since I am somewhat responsible for the workstations of this facility and they seem to break after a certain time "by themselves", I will try to create a PC that can be reverse-engineered and does not break through anomalous means. -Laskenta

Input: One PC
Setting: Fine
Output: A cube (17.5x17.5x17.5 cm) of an alloy of all materials used in the PC. The cube can not be deformed or damaged by any force smaller than 250MN. On one side is a 2x2cm symbol which glows when the cube is pressured with more than 150N. The symbol is the source of the cube's durability, but will not hold any anomalous feature if printed onto anything but cubes of the same size and alloy.

Note: Note to everybody whom it will concern: Don't say "unbreakable" in front of 914. The cube will be handed to next person asking me stuff about their writing software. - Laskenta

Input: One PC
Setting: Fine
Output: The same PC. After using the test result for more than two hours, an anomalous effect will make the nearest user believe the object is broken. The affected subject will seek Researcher Laskenta the next person of technical skill to ask for help. Result immediately incinerated by Laskenta, after the standard inspection revealed the effect.

Input: One PC
Setting: Fine
Output: A slightly smaller reinforced metal object. The insides seemed to be a working computer until holes for the power supply and ports were cut, where all function ceased. Any attempt to boot the machine up has met with failure. Result disassembled. No part, besides the CPU, held any anomalous feature afterwards.

Note: "What has no inputs, can not be broken." Thank you, 914, but it can also not be used. I request a second review of all parts for other anomalous features. If they don't hold any, I propose to use them to build another PC. - Laskenta

Name: Junior Researcher Jimson, D-49918, D-49919
Date: 22/06/2019
Total Items: 5 old texts acquired from a local book sale.

Note: Between cognitohazards and oil baths, I've decided using a D-class is the only smart things to do.

Input: A copy of the Encyclopædia Britannica Vol. 11 dated 1952
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of shredded paper and book covering. Some parts appear to have been singed while others appear to be torn. No cut marks were noted.

Input: The complete works of William Shakespeare.
Setting: Coarse
Output: A book titled "A Complete Anthology of Vogon Poetry". Upon retrieval from the output booth, D-49918 took it upon himself to open the book and read some poetry. Upon doing so, his brain activity immediately ceased. Book was incinerated.

Note: While I'm curious what combination of words could possibly lead someone's brain to stop functioning, I've read The Hitchhiker's Guide and know enough to not find out for myself. I thought burning the book would be doing the universe a service.

Input: One copy of Merriam-Webster's English dictionary
Setting: 1:1
Output: One copy of the Oxford English dictionary.

Input: One Physician's Desk Reference dated 1977
Setting: Fine
Output: One Physician's Desk Reference dated 2063. Result sent for study and possible usage by the medical staff on-site.

Note: Nice! If it's real then that should have some new tricks to make our doctors happy.

Note: It would be, but the text references instruments that don't actually exist, as well as some unknown anatomical terms. - Veritas

Input: One text entitled "The Complete World of Greek Mythology" by Richard Buxton
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One ornate hard, paper box with a hinged lid clasped shut. On the top of the box was inscribed the words "Jimson's Box". A note was found next to the box that read "Do not open". Given the myth concerning Pandora's Box, D-49919 was terminated by security forces on JR Jimson's order when attempting to open the box after retrieval from the output booth. Output placed in secure storage locker while awaiting approval for further testing.

Note: Why "Jimson's Box"? Am I supposed to open it? Is it weird that I'm very tempted to see what's inside? I'd like to request permission to study the contents of this box in a controlled setting to determine its potential value to society. -Junior Researcher Jimson

Note: Denied. Opening something with even slight resemblance to the mythical object sounds like a poor idea. - Veritas

Test 914-0881
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 23/06/2019
Total Items: Three crushed bass trombones.

Note: Got these from a local scrapyard; the previous owner wrecked their car with these inside. I'll leave the "B-flat" puns to you lot. - Prof. Wren

Input: One trombone.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One brass oven door.

Note: Took me a minute to realize this was a reference to the "When Mom's not home" video meme. -Prof. Wren

Input: One trombone.
Setting: Fine
Output: One set of brass dominos with a straw-sized hole on the top and bottom. Blowing into either hole on any of the dominos produces 1 of 28 distinct tones.

Note: The tones sound kinda like a brass piccolo. Neat. Permission to hold onto these, Dr. Veritas? I have an idea for making a singular instrument out of them for when they're not being used as dominos. -Prof. Wren

Note: You know the drill, Wren. Keep them, but if it sucks out one or all vital organs etc etc. - Veritas

Input: One trombone.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A brass animatronic figure of jazz legend Louis Armstrong, 13.6cm tall. Upon exiting the output booth, figure began to sing "What A Wonderful World" to the D-class conducting the experiment. All personnel within audible range stopped and listened; 17 personnel, including the D-class, were brought to tears by the song. Later testing revealed the figure required a recharge period of 9 hours before being able to perform again, at which point it played one of Louis Armstrong's most popular songs at random. Songs that have been played as of this time include:
-What A Wonderful World
-Mack the Knife
-Hello Dolly
-When The Saints Go Marching In
-We Have All the Time in the World
-When You're Smiling

Note: That was…glorious. I'm tempted to suggest putting this in the break room, but then we'd probably have everyone on Site trying to take their breaks all at the same time. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0882
Name: Intern Walker
Date: 24/06/2019
Total Items: Five plastic molecular model sets

Note: I have studied the experiment logs extensively, and am excited to see what happens. - Intern Walker

Input: One plastic molecular model set
Setting: Rough
Output: An amorphous pile of melted plastic, of similar weight to the input.

Input: One plastic molecular model set
Setting: Coarse
Output: Ten piles of powder, sorted by hue

Input: One plastic molecular model set
Setting: 1:1
Output: One plastic set of generic building blocks. Piece count and colors are similar to that of the input.

Note: Ha, I get it. Atoms are the building blocks of matter, so it turned them into actual building blocks.

Input: One plastic molecular model set
Setting: Fine
Output: One plastic sheet, resembling the Periodic Table of Elements. The names and atomic symbols appear to be carved into the plastic. Upon closer examination, it has eight rows, but the eighth row is completely blank, save the first four elements, each of which have their temporary IUPAC names. The elements are color coded based on what group they belong to.

Input: One plastic molecular model set
Setting: Very Fine
Output: unchanged The model will now assemble itself based on which "atoms" are next to each other, preferring molecular configurations which would have the lowest bond energy. They snap together as if they were magnets, but cutting them open reveals nothing extraordinary. The molecules appear to take on the properties of what they represent. Will be taken for further testing.

Note: My hands have slight chemical burns from attempting to pick up a sulfur dioxide molecule. I wish I was wearing protection. Looking back, this experiment could've turned out far worse. I shall take note to wear adequate protection next time. - Intern Walker

Date: 25/06/2019

Note: During testing, a chemical reaction occurred between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], causing an explosion in the adjacent testing area. The only induced casualties were my eyebrows. As it turns out, exothermic reactions will release energy proportional to the size of the model times the amount of energy the real reaction will produce. Testing has ceased, and the chemical set has been placed in anomalous storage. If anyone wishes to access it, I would advise extreme caution. - Intern Walker

Output: The mug has been welded on top of the coffee machine, and will be constantly filled to the top with coffee. If the coffee is removed without drinking it directly from the mug, it will be replaced with a sharp metal dust, as soon as it enters a human digestive system, which will result in severe abdominal pain for the drinker. The coffee machine will work as expected, but upon making coffee everybody within close range of the machine will feel a strong sense of guilt.

Note: This will not do for the break room. I will disassemble the output. I am just happy that Very Fine didn't result in… something like 3023. -Laskenta

Addendum: Upon separating the mug from the coffee machine, both items grew metallic limps and attacked everybody in sight with hot coffee. Both items were quickly disabled and incinerated by security. Result held no anomalous traits afterwards. No casualties, besides first degree burns on the hands and torso of Researcher Laskenta, who separated the items.

Note: I need coffee and a day off. Sorry Walker, maybe next time. -Laskenta

Note: I told you it wouldn't work, and now look. You wasted so much perfectly good coffee. And we need a new coffee machine. - Walker

Note: The one I have in my room (brought from home) will be used as a compensation in the break room until I buy a new one. -Laskenta

Test 914-0884
Name: Intern Snevets
Date: 25/06/2019
Total Items: One hockey referee's sweater, one soccer ball, one full set of football equipment.

I wasn't planning to do any testing today, but the gym was cleaning out some of their old stuff, so I asked if I could use a bit of it. Don't worry, it's all been disinfected. - Intern Snevets

Input: One hockey referee's sweater.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A miniature figure of a seeing-eye dog, complete with harness.

Input: One soccer ball.
Setting: Fine
Output: A tiny stage made of rubber and plastic.

So far, these seem to be based on sports stereotypes. Maybe the football gear will have something to do with concussions? - Intern Snevets

Input: One set of football equipment.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An animate set of football equipment. Proceeded to charge out of the output booth at full speed, avoiding researchers, and collided with the far wall head first. It then proceeded to slam its "head" against the wall until the helmet cracked, at which point the equipment deanimated and collapsed. Remains found to be non-anomalous.

That was… frightening. - Intern Snevets

Test 914-0885
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 25/06/2019
Total Items: One map of Yugoslavia dated 1980, one A5 size photo of Facility 23 on 30/04/2019, one A4 size photo of SCP-2118 dated 2017

Input: Map of former Yugoslavia.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One paper accordion. Object plays the 1993 Yugoslav song "Karadžić, Lead Your Serbs" for two hours before unfolding itself to reveal an ethnic map of Yugoslavia dated 1991.

Note: Not that… goodness. - Dr. Cleveland

Input: Photo of Facility 23
Setting: 1:1
Output: A presidential portrait of Mitt Romney dated 2017.

Note: Apparently it's telling me what quantum politics is. - Dr. Cleveland

Input: Photo of SCP-2118
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An A5 size portrait with the words "Arbeitsminister Charlotte Pletscher, 2041 - die Gegenwart" at the bottom, and a map of the "Republik Deutsch-Wisconsin", roughly covering the states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Theorized to be from a timeline where the United States collapsed during the Great Depression.

Note: This strikes me as confusing. - Dr. Cleveland

Test 914-0886
Name: Researcher Graymont
Date: 25/06/2019
Input: [REDACTED] Brand cordless drills weighing 2.5kg with battery discharged, 1kg of plastic similar to plastic used for drill, 2 kg of copper, 2 kg of steel, 500 grams of insulating rubber, 200 grams of lithium, 300 grams of silicone.

Note: I'm back, and I plan to be much more careful with these tests. As such, I will be wearing body armor, and a helmet with safety glasses. - Graymont

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Fine
Output: Small electric motorcycle with large drill bits as wheels. Battery's efficiency ranges wildly, with it occasionally lasting 30 seconds and other times several hours. The motorcycle only weighs 8.5kg and is much smaller than average motorcycles so it is essentially useless.

Note: These experiments are really gonna be interesting, especially if these results stay so unpredictable - Graymont

Note: Welcome back, Graymont. And don't worry, the only thing that's been predictable about 914's results is the unpredictability. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0887
Name: Researcher Edith
Date: 25/06/2019
Total Items: Five identical "Etch A Sketch" drawing pads

Input: One "Etch a Sketch" pad
Setting: Rough
Output: A single, generic, non-anomalous "Etch A Sketch" with a cracked screen

Note: To be blunt, I'm not quite sure what I was expecting to occur differently. - R. Edith

Input: One "Etch a Sketch" pad
Setting: Course
Output: A single, generic, non-anomalous "Etch A Sketch" with each grain of aluminum powder removed from the pad and set into a small, neat pile.

Note: Not quite as broken as on rough, though still will require some tedious repair if it is to work again. - R. Edith

Input: One "Etch a Sketch" pad
Setting: 1:1
Output: An "Sketch An Etch". Further inspection showed that both the left knob and right knob's controls had been reversed.

Input: One "Etch a Sketch" pad
Setting: Fine
Output: A single, generic, "Etch A Sketch" with the property to draw, seemingly, at its own accord. The scenes drawn before item relocation included:

- A well detailed dog. Breed assumed to be border collie
- A can of Lysol Disinfectant Spray, equally detailed as the dog
- A stick figure looking downwards at what appeared to be a spilled carton of milk
- Seven plain lines arranged in a seemingly specific order. The meaning has yet to be determined

Note: Odd indeed, especially the last drawing. I cant help but wonder what it is. - R. Edith

Input: One "Etch a Sketch" pad
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A single, generic, "Etch A Sketch" with a behavior changing property that is activated upon use by any one person. While being used, the user is almost instantaneously granted the ability to draw with great real-life accuracy and detail. The user is hyper-focused on finishing the drawing and unable to be distracted outside of physical interference.

Note: That was..a very strange experience. I'm not quite sure what I can really 'note' about it. - R. Edith

Test 914-0888
Name: Jr. Researcher Connor
Date: 27/06/2019
Total Items: One mug of coffee produced by SCP-914, one glass of water, one blank piece of paper.

Note: As I'm testing with products of SCP-914, D-class personnel will be used for all retrieval and testing. - Connor

Input: One mug of coffee from SCP-914
Setting: 1:1
Output: One mug of coffee. Testing on D-class personnel found that this coffee caused extreme drowsiness and lowered blood pressure and functioned similar to an anesthetic.

Input: One glass of water from SCP-914, one blank sheet of A4 paper.
Setting: Fine
Output: One sheet of A4 paper, with Foundation documentation on SCP-914. Glass of water was reported by D-class personnel to cause extreme nausea.

Note: Further testing required, particularly with more unusual liquids from SCP-914.

Test 914-0889
Name: Researcher Graymont
Date: 27/06/2019
Input: One Google Chromebook weighing approximately 1.5kg, 500 grams of silicone, fiberglass, and tin, 1kg of hardened steel

Note: The hardened steel is to see if 914 will find a use for it within a computer - Graymont

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Fine
Output: One Google "Steelbooc"(sic) weighing 3kg. It is a computer with an outer casing of hardened steel, and covered in a thin layer of silicone. Processing power is noted to be drastically slower and the computer is prone to overheating. Only benefit is that it seems to be immune to any attempts of unauthorized access within.

Note: The computer won't open unless I personally am near it and will it to open myself. Requesting permission to keep for storage of valuable personal information. - Graymont

Note: Denied. Rosen will blow a gasket if that thing encrypts everything on the intranet. - Veritas

Test 914-0890
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 01/07/2019
Total Items: Five 1kg spools of tie-dyed yarn.

Note: It's amazing what you can find at thrift stores sometimes, you know? -Prof. Wren

Input: One spool.
Setting: Rough
Output: 1kg of yarn, shredded beyond usability.

Input: One spool.
Setting: Coarse
Output: One spool of white yarn, 12 pools of colored dye between 0.05 and 0.7ml each.

Input: One spool.
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1kg of tie-dyed yarn crocheted into the SCP Foundation's logo.

Input: One spool.
Setting: Fine
Output: A 25cm x 25cm x 25cm "die" of yarn, mostly white, with the pips for five sides marked by circles of dye; each side marked this way uses one of five different colors. The "1" side of the die's pip is marked by a hole in the side. The hole reveals the interior to be hollow; if turned inside through this hole, the object's shape becomes that of an eight-sided die. The pips of the "2" through "8" side of it are marked with seven colors differing from each other and those used on the other side.

Note: This is equal parts neat, cute, and almost completely useless. -Prof. Wren

Note: You could probably make a working one out of rubber, though. - Intern Snevets

Input: One spool.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A paintbrush made completely of yarn; the bristles are made of loose strands while the extra-long handle is tightly woven to the point of rigidity. The yarn is mostly white; along the handle's length are 12 spots of different colors. Holding a finger over one or more of them and brushing the "bristles" along a surface alters the hue of whatever the bristles touch to match that of the color being touched, or a random mix of the colors if more than one is being touched. Brushing over a surface without any of the color spots being touched removes any changes.

Note: This could actually come in rather handy for any redecorating or paint touch-ups we ever have to do around here. Wonder how this stuff would affect organic compounds? Like hair, for example. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0891
Name: Doctor Mayo, D-46931
Date: 01/07/2019
Total Items: Five packs of standard playing cards.

Input: One pack of playing cards
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of ashes

Input: One pack of playing cards
Setting: Coarse
Output: The output booth was filled with cut up paper and ink residue was found on the walls and ceiling.

Note: Well that took longer than I thought to clean up. - Doctor Mayo

Input: One pack of playing cards
Setting: 1:1
Output: One deck of Magic The Gathering cards, the cards are slightly smaller than standard; this is to make up the full 60 cards from a 52 pack.

Note: I'm very impressed by this output, it is well worth noting that the deck is correctly formatted and includes some rare cards. The only let down is the inking on the cards is very light; this is most likely due to the amount of ink Magic The Gathering cards use versus standard playing cards. - Doctor Mayo

Note: Maybe it learned from me and Wren? -Researcher Maksymilian

Input: One pack of playing cards
Setting: Fine
Output: A house of cards.

Note: You always manage to surprise me 914. Every time. - Doctor Mayo

Input: One pack of playing cards
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A paper knight made of all the cards folded together. The knight kneeled and declared its loyalty to the foundation before asking to be helped out of the booth by D-46931. Result put in anomalous storage.

Test 914-0892
Name: Researcher Jay
Date: 01/07/2019
Total Items: Five copies of a single page with computer-generated random numbers.

Input: One Document
Setting: Rough
Output: Shredded paper.

Input: One Document
Setting: Coarse
Output: All numbers on the document have decreased in value by one.

Input: One Document
Setting: 1:1
Output: A paper with different random numbers.

Input: One Document
Setting: Fine
Output: Numbers are ordered from least to greatest.

Note: Jay didn't tell me that the paper had a 033 in it too. Before I realized all my math research was corrupted. The result was incinerated. -Researcher Maksymilian

Note: You should be lucky it didn't generate a grizzly bear from this mess. - Dr. Cleveland

Input: One Document
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Same document. Every two to four hours, a blueprint of varying hardware is written down autonomously.

Test 914-0893
Name: Guest Researcher Dr. Alex McDermott
Date: 01/07/2019
Total Items: One each of the following: Honda Silverwing scooter, 2.5kg block of lead, 256oz. jar of Dr. McDermott's blood

Note: Dr. McDermott's request only noted the use of the scooter for this test. Additional items were stowed within the scooter and were not authorized to be brought in.

Input: The lead block and jar.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The jar, now filled with a heavy, dense, gold-colored fluid.

Note: I've done it! The secrets of alchemy have at last been uncovered!

Note: Jar was inadvertently dropped and shattered after the test; the fluid within it then leapt straight at Dr. McDermott, covering his body and entering through multiple pores and orifices, terminating him within moments. Autopsy revealed the fluid had returned to his arteries and become regular blood again; cause of death was determined to be lead poisoning across all of his organs. No further anomalous properties detected from within his remains.

Test 914-0894
Name: Researcher Lime
Date: 01/07/2019
Total Items: Three drawings of SCP-914 (2 of which are photocopies).

Note: SCP-914 is apparently an art critic, so this can only end poorly.

Input: A drawing of SCP-914
Setting: 1:1
Output: A drawing of the back of SCP-914.

Note: We've only ever seen the back of 914 when it was transported here. It's interesting that it knows what itself looks like.

Input: A drawing of SCP-914
Setting: Fine
Output: An origami depiction of SCP-914. Notably, the top of the origami has gears drawn onto through careful burning, as well as the text on the control panel.

Note: Nothing happens when you put something in the booths. Permission to keep it? Its a very nice origami. Researcher Lime

Input: A drawing of SCP-914
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A long strip of paper, with the words "Opus Est Metallum" (The work of metal in Latin) written on it. After looking at it, the observer repeatedly say the word "tick", until either unconscious or forcibly amnesticised. Object incinerated without incident.

Test 914-0895
Name: Researcher Jay
Date: 01/07/2019
Total Items: Twenty-five mechanical pencils with pencil lead

Input: Five mechanical pencils
Setting: Fine
Output: Five black mechanical pencils with colored graphite, each color matching the colors of one of the mechanical pencils used for this test.

Input: Five mechanical pencils
Setting: Fine
Output: One dagger. The bottom of the hilt is made out of eraser material, the rest of the hilt made out of plastic, and the blade made out of graphite. The blade is disproportionately smaller than the hilt. Blade broke when attempting to write with it. Remains incinerated.

Input: Five mechanical pencils
Setting: Fine
Output: Five plastic needles with graphite syringes.

Input: Five mechanical pencils
Setting: Fine
Output: Five mechanical pencils, which, upon opening of the output booth, dispensed their lead which proceeded to poke at Researcher Jay's eyes. Result incinerated.

Input: Five mechanical pencils
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Five small rods of plastic rotating around a sphere made out of rubber and graphite in a twenty-five centimeter circle. The rods are pointing horizontally out from the sphere. The rods can be adjusted by an outside force to change their "orbit."

Test 914-0896
Name: Researcher Laskenta; D-46931
Date: 01/07/2019
Total Items: Several damaged external memory devices

Note: All used items belong to Foundation personnel, who asked me to retrieve their data. Since all data-recovery failed and the data is not important enough to use other anomalous machinery, I will use 914 as my very last attempt to get the files back. -Laskenta

Input: One Foundation flash drive (USB 2.0 Stick; 128GB), cleanly cut in half
Setting: Fine
Output: Two small USB Sticks, assumed to hold 64GB each. When connected directly to a USB port, the device, the output is connected to, will be cut in two pieces by an unknown unstoppable force. When connected via an extension, the extension will be cut in the same fashion. As soon as the extension is repaired while the result is still connected, the extension will be cut again. Connecting both outputs at the same time to a device will lead to the exact same result. Due to this effect, no data can be read (nor written).

Input: One Foundation external hard drive (backup drive; 4TB) with two bullet holes (no bullets)
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A 15.625cm small metallic humanoid figure; a small pistol in the hand of the figure. The figure is not sentient but is able to speak English. After the output booth opened, the figure introduced itself as "The Second Backup", asked who called it and swore it's loyalty to Researcher Laskenta after he responded. The figure is able to correctly answer any question regarding itself or the pistol. The figure is able to carry the weight of 25.875kg and run with a speed of 7.375km/h. The pistol has an infinite amount of bullets and can only be fired by the figure. The pistol itself inflicts as much damage as a needle, but the target will be paralysed for 2 seconds, as if mentally absent, and will randomly think of a two-digit hexadecimal number. Both effects only work on humans with a cognitohazard resistance value of <64. Shooting on the same target within those 2 seconds will neither replace the thought of the old numbers with new ones or extend the time stunned. Shooting another target will result in the same numbers and will extend the duration of the cognitohazard on the first target by 2 seconds. Both outputs are indestructible by any known means.

Note: I commanded the Second Backup to guard my office and shoot at everybody who enters my room without knocking, and who does not close my door properly. It seems to be unable to shoot at me, even when he does not know it's me. Permission to keep, if I hang up a warning sign? -Laskenta

Note: That's hilarious, Laskenta. - Veritas

Note: The numbers are the hexadecimal equivalent of the bytes which were stored on the input. It would take more than 253,000 years to get all information back. - Rosen

Note: The reason I use Coarse in this test, is to see if the coffee can be separated from the device without damaging the device itself. I don't exactly believe that this will work. -Laskenta

Input: One Foundation external hard drive (backup drive; 4TB) with coffee stains
Setting: Coarse
Output: The same hard drive without coffee; a small puddle of coffee. The drive can not be read but can be written to. The coffee holds the information contained on the drive. an infohazard which causes everybody who knows about the output to believe that it contains the information on the drive until proven otherwise. Result incinerated.

Note: This is the very first time that Coarse has made anything related to a cognitohazard. I assume this happened because I separated information and the coffee from the drive. I will stop testing for now, so as to not endanger the facility. -Laskenta

Test 914-0897
Name: Researcher Jay
Date: 01/07/2019
Total Items: Three chessboards set up with three sets of chess pieces

Note: We know that 914 plays chess with 1:1, but what will it do on fine and very fine?

Input: One chessboard, one set of pieces.
Setting: Fine
Output: One Capablanca chess set with a hollow board.

Input: One chessboard, one set of pieces
Setting: Fine
Output: One chess set with inverted colors.

This is an art piece more than a chess set and it's hurting my eyes. -Researcher Jay

Input: One chessboard, one set of pieces
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One unbreakable chessboard and set of pieces in the shape of Afghanistan. Every seven seconds, one of the pieces will move that is a legal chess move, alternating between black and white. After extensive analysis, the following patterns have been observed:

Pieces will never capture each other
No move by one side that would result in the other side having an advantage will be made
All moves made will be defensive, restricting to the other side or prophylactic
When there is no legal move that follows all the above patterns, the pieces will all simultaneously move back to their starting positions, with white then making a move
When an object is placed on the chessboard, the nearest non-pawn piece will make legal moves (If the object is placed next to a bishop and fits entirely inside the square, the second-nearest piece will be selected, unless it is the other color's bishop on the opposite color square as the object. Then it will be the third-nearest piece. This is assumed to happen because the bishop can not make any legal move to push the object.) to push it off the chessboard. It is hypothesized to be able to move an infinite amount of mass, as the pieces have successfully moved every tested object off the chessboard. If the piece selected to push the object would be moved as part of the move-cycle, no moves will be made until the piece in question has moved back to it's original position.
If the chessboard is tilted, the pieces will not slide to the edge and fall off. If it is placed upside-down on a surface, it will flip itself over.
The pieces have resisted all attempts to move them by outside forces.

Note: This is beautiful. Permission to keep for further analysis? I'm sure I can learn something from it. - Researcher Jay.

Note: Granted. - Veritas

Test 914-0898
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 01/07/2019
Total Items: One note reading "1.03 million", one 2m by 3m flag of the People's Republic of China

Input: Note
Setting: 1:1
Output: One note reading "1 L0ve Y0u 3000" (sic).

Input: Flag of China
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A 2m by 3m flag of Vietnam. Anyone viewing the flag will have the urge to create a post on any social media platform (Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram being the preferred methods) which urges the government of China to "follow Vietnamese policies on the Internet". China is known to be one of the few countries which has a concurrent ban of all three aforementioned social media sites, which is starkly contrasted to Vietnam, which has a similar government and economic structure but minimal Internet censorship.

Name: Researcher Laskenta; D-46931
Date: 03/07/2019
Total Items: Four metal mugs, filled with black tea

Note: We had many test lately with uncommon inputs. So I will just try to make coffee. -Laskenta

Input: One mug of black tea.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One mug, filled with green tea.

Input: One mug of black tea.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One metal mug, filled with water; a small cluster of tea leaves.

Note: D-46931 and I checked if the dial was on Coarse. It was not. - Laskenta

Input: One mug of black tea.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One tea mug, filled with metal. Result collapsed instantly. No anomalous traits detected.

Note: Output booth cleaned by myself. The metal will be used for another mug when I got time. - Laskenta

Input: One filled mug
Setting: 1:1 Fine
Output: One mug, filled with coffee. The same mug with another fluid. The fluid in the mug can only be described as normal coffee, which it is. Result incinerated. The output was the same mug filled with coffee. It is coffee. The tea in the input booth was not put into 914 without changeing it beforehand.

Note: I slipped on a bit of tea that I missed and accidentally turned the dial to Fine. Not describing the coffee and then using the words, was the only way to describe it. I will get myself a coffee without effects that imitate me. -Laskenta

Test 914-0902

Setting: Fine
Output: Same lawn chair. Sitting in it for extended periods of time slightly improves social skills.

Note: Is that a pun? -Researcher Jay.

Input: One plastic lawn chair
Setting: Fine
Output: Lawn chair. Upon output door opening, the straps snapped. It is assumed that the straps were pulled tighter.

Input: One plastic lawn chair
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One plastic lawn chair. Anything that can be used as sunscreen or purposed as sunscreen within a 320 meter radius is anomalously attracted to the chair, and will compress into an 2 centimeter layer. Anything placed on the seat of the chair will be enveloped by sunscreen within a minute. If the object is not alive and/or does not have a dermal layer, it will be catapulted away at speeds of around 60 km/h. If the object is alive and does have a dermal layer, the object (excluding the dermal layer) will be catapulted away at speeds excess of 90km/h, ripping open the dermal layer which will dissolve into the sunscreen upon contact. This process was only non-fatal in one case.

Note: Incinerated. Who even had sunscreen anyway? -Researcher Jay

Test 914-0905
Name: Intern Voltê
Date: 08/07/2019
Total Items: Five 10 kilogram cubes of malachite

I got transferred here, so I thought I might as well be productive. Least I could do. -Intern Voltê

Input: One cube
Setting: Rough
Output: Many small, irregularly shaped pieces of malachite

Input: One cube
Setting: Coarse
Output: A pile of cupric oxide, an anomalously stable puddle of carbonic acid

Note: The carbonic acid was quite difficult to get off the booth floor, but as far as I can tell no damage has been done to the booth. -Intern Voltê

Note: Junior Researcher Kai mentioned the possibility of better quality soft drinks at the cafeteria, using the same anomalous stability that the puddle of carbonic acid demonstrated. After conversing with me about investigating the properties of the diluted carbonic acid, Junior Researcher Kai decided to taste some of the carbonic acid from a cup, which did not seem to be corrosive after preliminary testing. -Intern Voltê

Note: My tongue is stinging a little, but I surprisingly feel fine. No burps coming up though. -Junior Researcher Kai

Input: One cube
Setting: 1:1
Output: One 10 kilogram sphere of malachite

Input: One cube
Setting: Fine
Output: One 10 kilogram piece of malachite in the shape of the island of Malta

Input: One cube
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One 10 kilogram piece of malachite in the shape of a "Thwomp" from the Mario franchise, anomalously suspended 3 meters above the floor of the output booth. When any sapient being comes within 1 meter of it, it will lose it's anomalous suspension. Upon hitting the ground, it will rise to 3 meters off the ground at a rate of 25 centimeters per second.

Test 914-0906
Name: Researcher Jay
Date: 08/07/2019
Total Items: Five white sticks of chalk

Input: One stick
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of chalk dust

Input: One stick
Setting: Coarse
Output: Two chalk sticks, adding up to the mass of the original chalk stick

Input: One stick
Setting: 1:1
Output: A slab of gypsum

Input: One stick
Setting: Fine
Output: One stick of chalk. If used to write on a surface, it is impossible to write anything other than the word "Gerald."

Input: One stick
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Five small rods of chalk. Each one levitates towards the nearest visual sensory organ at a rate of 10 m/h. Easily stopped by walls. Upon touching a visual sensory organ, it will appear on the other side of the organism who's visual sensory organ it has targeted. Autopsies reveal that organisms are penetrated by the rod at an approximately 350 km/h in its previous direction of movement. No other effects are noted upon contact.

Test 914-0907
Name: Researcher Qaniz
Date: 08/07/2019
Total Items: Five periodic table of elements (Mendeleev edition) A3 wallpapers

Input: One wallpaper
Setting: Rough
Output: The same wallpaper shredded, output shreds sorted based on a color wheel

Input: One wallpaper
Setting: Coarse
Output: Element symbols cut out, sorted by atomic radius

Input: One wallpaper
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Janet edition periodic table wallpaper

Input: One wallpaper
Setting: Fine
Output: One very small book written in old English. Each page seems to explain the properties of an element, containing unknown words explaining a variety of undefined properties of each element. The book contains an infinite amount of pages, most of which explain undiscovered or unidentifiable elements.

Note: 914 seems to enjoy teasing us with things that could greatly help us by giving them to us in the most useless form possible. At least some of the illustrations are cool. I'm going to keep it in my office if that's alright, hopefully it doesn't melt me overnight with radiation or something. - Qaniz

Input: One wallpaper
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One periodic table wallpaper with variations from the original edition. Latin symbols of each element have been replaced by Greek letters (relations of each element and its Greek symbol are unknown). No anomalous properties documented after testing Speaking the name of any element (using any language, even made up languages) while looking at the wallpaper causes the subject to behave as if they are made of the mentioned element. This memetic effect is extremely strong, affecting 100% of subjects tested so far, amnestics and even complete memory wipe does not negate this effect. See addendum for more information.

Test 914-0908
Name: Researcher Jay

Input: One USB drive
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The document is now titled "914 Brand Hops [sic]." The text file contains a cognitohazardous image that causes effects of intoxication in viewers lasting up to six hours.

Test 914-0909
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 08/07/2019
Total Items: Three Transformers themed 8GB USB flash drives, each containing an MP4 copy of the 1986 animated film Transformers the Movie.

Note: All 3 flash drives are modeled on the Decepticon "Ravage." Each flash drive has 2 configurations; a "disguised" configuration resembling a standard flash drive, and a "transformed" configuration resembling a robotic panther. I thought these were pretty neat a few years back, but nowadays the limited storage space makes them a tad useless, so…bon voyage, little friends. -Prof. Wren

Note: At the start of each test, each drive will be in its "disguised" configuration.

Input: A USB drive.
Setting: 1:1
Output: The same flash drive, now in its "transformed" configuration. Drive data altered to include MP3s of the soundtrack to Transformers the Movie. Sound quality is equivalent to that of a tape cassette.

Note: I consider this an upgrade rather than a tradeoff, personally. -Prof. Wren

Input: A USB drive.
Setting: Fine
Output: The same flash drive. Analysis shows it can now hold up to 128TB of data. Drive data altered to include MP4s of all episodes of the 1980s Transformers animated series in 7 languages. Video and sound quality are comparable to Blu-Ray.

Note: I'll have copies available to anyone who wants one. Same with the soundtrack. Well, those were two very pleasant tests…dare I hope for a trifecta? -Prof. Wren

Input: A flash drive.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The same flash drive. Upon the output booth opening, device switched to its "transformed" state, making a sound identified as the transformation sound from the 1980s Transformers animated series. Device attacked D-class administering test with a mouth-fired laser weapon before attempting containment breach. Breach thwarted when device was captured and destroyed by D-class. Analysis of data on drive is currently on hold.

Note: I wouldn't. For all we know, hooking that thing up to something may just give us another shapeshifting deathbot, only with more material to work with. Still, as horrifying as the thought of creating a real-life Decepticon is, it was almost adorable watching it trying to dig through a door that had about 8,000x its mass. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0910
Name: Doctor Mayo, D-46931
Date: 08/07/2019
Total Items: Five wooden statuettes of Keanu Reeves.

Note: I've been into whittling for a while and decided with all the recent love for Keanu i'd have my hand at making some statuettes of him. I have three spare if anyone would like one. - Doctor Mayo

Input: One statuette.
Setting: Rough
Output: Ash in the shape of Keanu Reeves' face spread on the bottom of the output booth.

Input: One statuette.
Setting: Coarse
Output: The statuette has been converted into a wooden action figure of Keanu Reeves and dismantled. The parts were laid out from left to right as; one head, one torso, two arms and two legs. The joints have been rounded to balls and sockets which fit snugly when reassembled.

Input: One statuette.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A statuette of Doctor Veritas. The facial expression is stern and stands with arms crossed.

Note: The craftsmanship on this is not half bad actually. It really brings out the fierce look in his eyes. - Doctor Mayo

Input: One statuette.
Setting: Fine
Output: A statuette of an unidentified mountain range. An anomalous affect of a cool breeze is experienced when observing the statuette. All who feel the breeze immediately feel calm and collected.

Input: One statuette.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: No change noted to the statuette when the output booth was opened by D-46931 The statuette walked to the edge of the booth whispered something to D-46931 who immediately collapsed. An autopsy on D-46931 found that the cause of death was asphyxiation with no physical cause identified. The output has been incinerated.

Test 914-0911
Name: Researcher Jay
Date: 10/07/2019
Total Items: 27 two-tiered boxes of bottled water

Note: I don't know if there's any official term, but what I mean by two-tiered boxes of bottled water is just one cardboard 'tray' on top of another, collectively wrapped in plastic. -Researcher Jay

Input: Three boxes of bottled water
Setting: 1:1
Output: One six-tiered box of bottled water

Input: Three boxes of bottled water
Setting: 1:1
Output: Three boxes of bottled water, labeling changed to "Diet Diet Coke"

Input: Three boxes of bottled water
Setting: 1:1
Output: One barrel of water, with a mixture of plastic and cardboard lining the interior.

Input: Three boxes of bottled water
Setting: Fine
Output: Six boxes (one-tier) of sparkling water, no cardboard

Input: Three boxes of bottled water
Setting: Fine
Output: Three boxes of an unknown substance. Ignited upon opening of the output door.

Input: Three boxes of bottled water
Setting: Fine
Output: Three boxes of bottled oxygen and hydrogen. Exploded upon opening of output booth.

Input: Three boxes of bottled water
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Three boxes of bottled "Dehydrated Water." Consumption causes severe dehydration. Application to skin causes skin to rapidly dry out.

Input: Three boxes of bottled water
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Three boxes of "Holley [sic] Water." If consumed, it will cause the following effects starting within three hours, in this order:

1. The drinker will spontaneously combust for a maximum of thirty seconds. While this does cause death, the body will remain intact, and noticeably cleaner than before consumption.

2. A extradimensional anomaly will form under the body immediately after, which the body will fall into. This extradimensional space is consistent between drinkers, and is estimated to be a three meter deep circular hole with a radius of 1.5 meters. The walls and floor are made out of metal until the third effect.

3. Anything inside the interior of the extradimensional space, including the walls and floor, are transmuted into Swiss cheese over the course of about four hours. Removing the body will cause no further effects. At completion, everything inside appears to be non-anomalous Swiss cheese.

4. Various plants from the genus Holly will grow from the holes in the cheese at an accelerated rate, reaching full maturity within 9 hours. Berries are non-anomalous.

5. A Christmas-themed trolley will burst from the bottom of the hole, moving upwards at a constant speed of 127 km/h between one and two hours after the plants reach maturity. Upon exiting the hole, the extradimensional anomaly will cease to exist. The trolley will disappear upon reaching the approximate orbit of the moon.

Test 914-0912
Name: Junior Researcher Kai
Date: 10/07/2019
Total Items: One note reading "Hello SCP-914, I'm new here and I hope we can develop a relationship better than the ones you have with some of the more senior staff here." and one HB pencil.

Note: I just arrived and took a quick glance at 914's testing logs. What is up with all the antagonism? - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: Aforementioned note.
Setting: Fine
Output: One neat heap of shredded paper, same HB pencil. The pencil was noted to be a lot shorter, as if used for an extended period of time. When pieced together, the paper displayed a cognitohazard.

Note: I had believed that only happened on the "Coarse" setting. That was somewhat… disappointing. - Junior Researcher Kai

Note: On a hunch, I decided to take a look at the paper shreds instead of disposing of them as per regulation. Upon piecing them together at the cafeteria, a cognitohazard was formed that makes anyone viewing it believe that they are new to Site-19 and have just been assigned to work with SCP-914 and the time it lasted was inversely proportional to the amount of time the affected researcher has worked with 914 prior to this test. As amusing it was to see some of the more senior staff treat 914 as if they have never seen it before, I had to go inform Site Security. Luckily the newer researchers, interns and I weren't affected, and everything was back to normal after amnestics were administered to the senior staff.- Junior Researcher Kai

Test 914-0913
Name: Dr. Oren
Date: 10/07/2019
Total Items: A full edition of Ivan Krylov's (Ivan Krylov is the most well-known fable writer of Russia, known for both retellings of Aesop's fables and his own original ones, both in verse) fables in English and Russian side by side, English in prose form.

Note: Let's see if it can be improved - Dr. Oren

Input: Aforementioned book.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A book containing all of Krylov's fables, with a few he left unfinished now complete. Text is in Russian. Whenever read by someone who prefers another language, a translation of the fables appears alongside the original, at a level comparable to the best known professional translators and in perfect verse. Whoever views the fables feels compelled to act in a way consistent with their moral, sometimes to the extent of severe damage to oneself if previous behavior contradicted it heavily.

Note: The following test was unauthorized. We are catching word on this now from Berco's full confession to her psychiatrist. Veritas is absolutely furious. The only reason he only suspended her instead of termination is that she gave herself up. Transferred off-Site. The following information is recovered off of a flash drive she handed in, containing 5 minutes of the surveillance footage of 914. - Dr. Ira

Test 914-0914
Name: Dr. Berco
Date: 11/07/2019
Total Items: Jar, filled with 1-1.3 kgs of ash, 56 grams of iron shavings, two golden rings inset with sapphire.

Input: 1/4th of collected ash, iron shavings.
Setting: Fine
Output: Twisted, iron heart-shaped pendant. Dr. Berco put the pendant in her pocket and continued testing.

Note: Dr. Berco wore the necklace around until the time of her meeting with her psychiatrist. I believe they let her keep it after thorough testing for anomalous properties. - Jr. Researcher Karen

Input: Remainder of ash, both rings.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A pair of glasses. The bridge was made from sapphire, frames made from the gold, and the glass made from extremely thin sapphire. Dr. Berco put the glasses on, and stepped back from 914 in distress, staring at the floor. She knelt, and made motions not dissimilar to petting a small animal. No such animal appeared on surveillance footage. Dr. Berco then made motions of lifting the entity before quickly shuffling out of the building. It is suspected that she had paid off the guards ahead of time, as none moved to intercept her, despite being there after hours.

Note: Security Personnel has been terminated. Lucius assigned Dr. Berco to mandatory psychiatric evaluation. - Hackett

Test 914-0915
Name: Researcher Graymont
Date: 11/07/2019
Total items: One standard metal snow shovel, a standard pair of gardening shears, a standard metal leaf rake, 200g copper, 200g tin, 3g gold, 400g fiberglass, 200g silicone 10g hafnium

Note: Again, testing raw materials and objects in 914. This time with computer components and a variety of handheld gardening tools - Graymont

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Fine
Output: A tool labeled "The Souper Tool" a highly efficient computer appears to be fixed to the side of a block of metal and wood. There is a display on the computer made of an unknown alloy consisting of various materials inputted. The display has three options labeled as "Scoop" "Filter" and "Feed". Upon using the scoop function, the object became animate and ran toward the break room. Object was caught, presumably it was pursuing soup.

Note: After some testing, the scoop function scoops a small amount of soup using a miniature shovel. It does nothing with the soup. The filter function removes all chunks from the soup. And, when tested on a D-Class, the feed function [DATA EXPUNGED] D-Class remains incinerated with the object. The mess was cleaned up. - Graymont

Test 914-0916
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 11/07/2019
Total items: Six random albums by Dublin-based band U2, all in CD format, formatted to 256kbps quality.

Input: Pop
Setting: Rough
Output: A shredded pile of plastic which spontaneously exploded with a "pop" sound. No casualties were recorded.

Input: No Line On the Horizon
Setting: Coarse
Output: The same album, formatted to 64kbps. Viewing the album cover causes the viewer to fail to recognize all horizons, ranging from the word "horizon", to the event horizon of a black hole, for a period of 12 minutes.

Note: Further experiments suspended for half an hour for Dr. Cleveland to recuperate.

Input: Boy
Setting: 1:1
Output: An album titled Girl, by an all-female musical group called "7F". No such group or album existed, and all music produced are played in reverse, and emotionally reversed to Boy.

Input: How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb
Setting: 1:1
Output: An unlabeled CD, containing a blueprint of a nuclear weapon with californium-251 as its core.

Note: Not practical at all. This isotope is too radioactive for any use as a nuke. - Cleveland

Input: The Joshua Tree
Setting: Fine
Output: A miniature model of a yucca brevifolia tree.

Input: Songs of Experience
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A miniature model of Bono (lead singer of U2), which will answer any question regarding the band, its members, and its music, so as long as the person posing the question is within five meters of it.

Test 914-0917
Name: Researcher Laskenta; D-47565
Date: 11/07/2019
Total Items: Three magic cubes (3x3x3)

Input: One cube
Setting: Fine
Output: One magic cube with different colours (black, light blue, russet, orange, violet & brown). Solving the cube will result in a random effect, which has been described by D-47565 as victory notification. Effects observed until now include: changing the colours on the cube to a picture of a rainbow for 3 seconds; playing the victory sound from the franchise "Final Fantasy"; projecting a hologram of [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] above the cube.

Note: Testing involved D-47565 and me solving this cube for four hours. (It feels better than the original.) We have not tested yet what happens, if nobody uses it for a while. Do I get permission to keep it, if it does nothing within a month? -Laskenta

Input: One cube
Setting: Fine
Output: One magic cube (4x4x4). The cube is as big as the input and therefore harder to turn than a normal cube of this size. Researcher Laskenta hypothesizes, that it is impossible to get a "LL parity" while normally solving the cube.

Note: A "LL parity" is a special case that occurs while solving a cube with an even size (4x4; 6x6 …). By using the beginner's method of solving, these cases occur as often as they do not.

Input: One cube
Setting: Fine
Output: The same cube. After turning the cube and letting it stay in one permutation for 5 seconds, a cognitohazard will affect everyone within line of sight of the user. All subjects will hear a Finnish phrase spoken by the user in their native language emanating from directly behind each subject. The phrase is chosen by the current permutation of the cube. The connection of the phrase to the permutation seem to be identical with SCP-2053-2.

Note: Until now neither 2053-1 nor the result of this test had shown any reaction to the permutations used during the tests. This will be put into anomalous storage, if neither the 2053-Team nor Dr. Veritas have any objections. -Laskenta

Note: Thinking of just making a standard form to allow keeping of object in exchange for accepting responsibility for something blowing your head off down the line. - Veritas

Test 914-0918
Name: Intern Voltê
Date: 11/07/2019
Total Items: Four hand-held mirrors.

Input: One mirror
Setting: Fine
Output: One mirror. Cracks appear in the reflected image.

Input: One mirror
Setting: Fine
Output: One reflective sphere.

Input: One mirror
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One hand-held Fresnel lens. All light that goes into the lens is anomalously reflected to come out of the center of the lens.

Input: One mirror
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One mirror. Looking into it increases focus and increases information processing speed. Effects cease upon looking away from the mirror, and rebound (mental fatigue) is felt for the duration of exposure time.

Test 914-0919
Name: Intern Walker
Date: 12/07/2019
Total Items: 30 Nanobots, 3 pictures of SCP-914's inner workings

Note: I've seen in the logs evidence of the machine being able to manipulate subatomic particles in the past. I've seen that it has since lost this ability. I have also seen that this machine is capable of making parts for itself. I wonder if it can make something that will repair it, so it will regain lost functionality. - Intern Walker

Input: 10 Nanobots, 1 picture of SCP-914
Setting: Fine
Output: A small, diamond-studded metallic replica of SCP-914. It is non-functional and non-anomalous.

Input: 10 Nanobots, 1 picture of SCP-914
Setting: Fine
Output: 10 Nanobots. When activated, they will disassemble anything in front of it, reassemble it into an output based on the position of SCP-914's dial. Progress is very slow depending on increase in object size.

Note: These nanobots seem to have the same functionality of 914, or at least on a miniature level. 914 is a lot faster. That said, I am absolutely terrified of getting in their way, and am worried that if they are kept around, someone will activate them and let them wander. Requesting permission to incinerate. - Intern Walker

Note: Way ahead of you, Walker. - Veritas

Input: 10 Repair Nanobots, 1 picture of SCP-914
Setting: Fine
Output: 10 Nanobots. When activated, they will seek out and repair clockwork devices. They have been tested on an grandfather clock that had been damaged due to age, and the clock now runs backwards. Disassembly shows that they clock does not have any additional or missing gears. The clock and the nanobots have been put into anomalous storage.

Note: These nanobots were so promising, too. Though I may be curious to find out what happens when 914's gears turn the other way, I am afraid that it wouldn't function properly. If someone else wants to try, and they are able to get permission, they are welcome to it.

Note: A lot of these gears and keys aren't designed to run backwards, so I'm not risking damaging the thing. We wouldn't know where to start retrofitting 914 in the first place anyway. - Veritas

Test 914-0920
Name: Dr. G. Adamere, visiting by request. Approved by Director Hackett 08/07/2019.
Date: 12/07/2019
Total Items: One aged children's book entitled The Box the Gift Came In (1983)

Note: Dr. Adamere declined to leave any notes, remarking that he had gotten permission through the correct channels to run a test, regarding effect on output, if any, to verbal or emotional stimuli in conjunction with whatever it is that allows SCP-914 to determine the 'meaning' behind an object. "You can take notes if you'd like, but I'd rather just leave once I'm done, thank you." Following notes taken by Security Booth Transcriber, J. Milton.

Dr. Adamere stated that his daughter, whom had recently passed away, would have wanted her favorite childhood book given to somebody (or something) that would appreciate it as much as she did. 'The Box the Gift Came In' is a morality tale about valuing the gift giver as much, if not more, than the gift itself.

Input: Dr. Adamere opens the input door and proceeds to read the entirety of the book out loud to SCP-914. Minor emotional distress is detected, but remains within limits due to circumstances. Approximately 17 seconds pass after the book is finished. After gathering himself, Dr. Adamere places the book very gently on the booth floor.
Setting: 1:1

Note: Upon review, SCP-914 performed operations at a slower speed than average by 19% according to visible movement of parts and audible sounds, but operation completed in a record speed of 72 seconds.

Output: An origami rose made of compressed paper, the petals decorated with illustrations from input. Upon retrieving output, Dr. Adamere smiled and began to weep. Security Officer L. Simmons entered the room to politely retrieve Dr. Adamere, who complied.

Note: Thank you, 914. Thank you so much. - Dr. Adamere

Note: The rose was checked for anomalies, but none were found. Hours later, Dr. Adamere was cleared to return to full duty by his grief councilor after "..an incredible turnaround from his previous mental state regarding his daughter."

Note: We're using my testing area for grief counseling now? - Veritas

Note: Give me this one exception, Lucius. - Dr. Hackett

Note: Fine, Arthur, but normal therapy for your friends next time. - Veritas

Note: Appreciate it. - Hackett

Test 914-0921
Name: Researcher Jay
Date: 15/06/2019 - 11/07/2019
Total Items: Twenty Twenty-one Twenty-two Twenty-three Twenty-four chess sets.

Note: The purpose of this test is to figure out how good 914 is at chess. I will be conducting this over the course of an estimated maximum of a month, as 914 has a history of throwing temper tantrums when it loses. I will have it play against twenty different chess computers, rated from 100 ELO to 2000 ELO at intervals of 100. I will start with having it play the highest rated computer, and if it loses terribly I'll go onto the next lowest rated computer. If it does okay, I will start having it play more games until I find the place where it beats the computers fifty-fifty. After analysis of it's previous games, I have estimated it to be below 1000. -Researcher Jay

[Tests 1-26 results available upon request, redacted for brevity]

Input: Previous output, with the computer's move made on the chessboard. Note that next move is mate.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One flipped chess board. Taken as resignation.

Note: Moving on to 1900. -Researcher Jay

[Tests 28-287 results available upon request, redacted for brevity. Four chessboards were broken during this time]

Input: Previous output, with computer's move made on the chessboard.
Setting: 1:1
Output: Checkmate by 914.

Note: That was 914 beating the 1100 computer. Having it play it again as well as 1000. -Researcher Jay

[Tests 288-314 results available upon request, redacted for brevity]

Input: Previous output, with both computer's move made on chessboard. Note that on both boards 914 is losing.
Setting: 1:1
Output: Two flipped chessboards. Taken as resignation.

[Tests 315-756 results available upon request, redacted for brevity]

Note: Averaging it's wins and losses, 914 appears to fall between 500 ELO and 800 ELO, which means that while it can beat the average person, with only a bit of training and practice it's easy to beat. It reliably beat the computer rated 200, and it only beat 1000 a couple of times. The time it beat the 1100 appeared to be pure luck. -Researcher Jay

Test 914-0922
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 11/07/2019
Total items: Six drawings, depicting the logos of the SCP Foundation; the Global Occult Coalition; the Chaos Insurgency; the Serpent's Hand; Marshall, Carter, and Dark, Ltd.; and Dr. Wondertainment.

Input: All of the above
Setting: Fine
Output: A comic scene, depicting the Avengers, the X-Men, and the Guardians of the Galaxy fighting in New York City. A flag, resembling the Nazi War flag with the HYDRA symbol in place of the Swastika, is seen from a distance. Several politicians, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, are seen evacuating Manhattan, as the Dark Phoenix is about to destroy it. Deadpool is also visible, holding an unidentified weapon with one hand, and flipping his middle finger with the other.

Did 914 just make a “in a nutshell” joke? - Doctor Flip

From the looks of it, yes. What I'm not sure, however, is if it views us or the GOC more highly. - Dr. Cleveland

Test 914-0923
Name: Researcher Qaniz
Date: 11/07/2019
Total Items: Four Peter Schmeichel Manchester United 1998/99 goalkeeper kits

The treble winning season, it's safe to say my life peaked that year - Qaniz

Input: One kit
Setting: Rough
Output: The kit cut and sewn as goalkeeper gloves,

Input: One kit
Setting: Coarse
Output: The kit cut into three pieces in the shapes of the Premier League trophy, the FA cup and the UEFA Champions League trophy

Input: One kit
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Kasper Schmeichel goalkeeper kit, the club crest and kit design does not belong to any known football clubs

Input: One kit
Setting: Fine
Output: One goalkeeper kit with the same design as the input kit but missing a name. instead the name of the kit's current wearer anomalously appears on the kit. Subjects wearing the kit instinctually attempt to catch or deflect any projectile in a 7.32 meter radius (distance of the two goalposts in football). These attempts have been 100% successful so far, including projectiles normally uncatchable by a human, such as bowling balls launched in dangerously high speeds, various bullets, arrows, eggs launched in speeds that would theoretically crack upon impact (caught without cracking), impact grenades, a car driving at 120 km/h towards the subject. The user has no control over their movements when using the output, and has to be separated by someone else. It is presumed that without help, the user will eventually expire due to dehydration.

Test 914-0924
Name: Dr. O’Malley
Date: 13/07/2019
Total Items: 4 pills of 200mg Ibuprofen, 2 pills of 4mg Ondansetron (Zofran), 1 bottle of Ipecac Syrup.

Input: 2 Ibuprofen pills.
Setting: 1:1
Output: 2 pills of generic Aspirin, imprinted with standard markings.

Input: 2 Ibuprofen pills.
Setting: Fine
Output: 2 foreign pills, identified to be chemically related to ibuprofen, but with a chemical substitution that increased activity 10 times. Tests resulted in similarly improved pain reduction, as well as dangerously low blood clotting factor for test subject.

Input: 1 bottle of Ipecac Syrup.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A vial of incredibly viscous, black, and sickly-sweet liquid. Upon consumption of a few drops, subject immediately projectile vomited his entire stomach contents across the test chamber with force, and continued to vomit bile for 4 hours.

Input: 1 pill of Zofran.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 pill, which dissolved easily on the subject’s tongue and immediately cured vomiting caused by aforementioned syrup. Side effects were magnified by a factor of roughly 7 and resulted in the subject being somewhat sedated, lasting for 12 hours.

Input: 1 pill of Zofran
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small, round pill containing black powder. Upon closer inspection, the pill is filled with minuscule nanobots coated in a material which facilitates movement from gut to bloodstream. Subject takes pill, and immediately falls to the ground unconscious. After 30 minutes subject wakes up without any apparent effects. Administered syrup from previous test, with no reaction. Scan of brain activity reveals that specific parts of the brain involved in the vomiting response, and nothing else, have been destroyed by the nanobots. Subject also no longer can taste bitterness.

Test 914-0925
Name: Researcher Graymont
Date: 13/07/2019
Input: Three Xbox 360 controllers, 200g plastic, 200g water, 300g steel

Note: Comparing and contrasting the uses certain materials provide with 914. - Graymont

Input: One controller, 200g plastic
Setting: Fine
Output: Controller with several added, though non-functional buttons. Controller functions as standard. Symbols do not correspond to any known language.

Input: One controller, 200g water
Setting: Fine
Output: Same controller and a blob of water with seemingly impenetrable surface tension. It does not combine with other water and does not get any surfaces wet. The controller controls the blob through anomalous means.

Input: One controller, 300g steel, instance(s) of SCP-609
Setting: Fine
Output: One controller that is invisible to any camera tested. The controller is cold to the touch, and can be manipulated by a person imagining the controller to be at another location. It is only visible to the naked eye. Unusable as a normal controller.

Note: The controller reminds me a lot of SCP 609, so I assume someone was experimenting with an instance, and imagined the input booth of 914. Resulting in this amalgamation of confusion. We are lucky the setting was only Fine and nothing else, who knows what could have come out of very fine. - Graymont

Test 914-0926
Name: Dr. Scott
Date: 17/07/2019
Total items: Fifteen paper plates

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Fifteen paper plates that resemble pepperoni pizza. The plates have been shown to emit a smell that is related to a pizza. The plates also are edible with subjects describing them as “Delicious”.

Test 914-0927
Name: Junior Researcher Kai
Date: 18/07/2019
Total Items: Four 8-tooth gears with 3, 3, 3 and 4 teeth missing respectively, one rough soapstone figurine of a featureless man

Note: I had picked up the gears and the figurine from a garage sale. Let's see what 914 can do. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: Broken gear with 3 teeth missing
Setting: Rough
Output: Two molten puddles of copper and zinc, both of which were not anomalous and started cooling and oxidisung immediately after the booth was opened

Note: Testing was halted temporarily while the metal was cleared from the booth by a rather annoyed Janitor Kurt and Junior Researcher Kai was reprimanded for creating an hazardous mess on the floor of the Output booth. The booth was scrubbed clean after minor application of pickling liquor. - Researcher Laskenta

Input: Broken gear with 3 teeth missing
Setting: Coarse
Output: The same gear, now with the remaining 5 teeth removed along a previously unnoticed stress fracture between the gear and the teeth.

Note: Apparently, 914 broke the welds between the central disc of the gear and the teeth. I hadn't even noticed that the gears' teeth were welded on. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: Broken gear with 3 teeth missing
Setting: 1:1
Output: A miniature model of SCP-914

Note: I'd wanted to set the dial to Coarse again to see if I could retrieve some more metal from the output. However, I didn't expect 1:1 to yield such an… interesting result. I've sent the model for preliminary testing. I'm putting the next gear through Fine, even though I hadn't originally intended to do so. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: Broken gear with 4 teeth missing
Setting: Fine
Output: A small lock and half a key

Input: Figurine
Setting: Fine
Output: A figurine of noticeably higher-quality carving, except now with a carved labcoat. Attempted to attack Junior Researcher Kai upon retrieval by D-class personnel and was incinerated immediately by security personnel.

Note: It looked suspiciously like Dr. Veritas. What did I do this time? - Junior Researcher Kai

Note: Junior Researcher Kai was later found outside Dr. Veritas' office with a letter of apology for the incident he had caused just over a week ago. He had not been notified of Dr. Veritas' holiday and was visibly distraught after hearing the news. I think he might just be imagining the resemblance. - Researcher Laskenta

Test 914-0928
Name: Dr. Leon
Date: 18/07/2019
Total items: a calendar and a pencil

Input: A calendar and a pencil
Setting: fine
Output: A calendar with notes ranging from to-do lists to quick notes about "what just happened" and from dates ranging from 01/01/2000 to 31/12/2099, and blackened wood pieces as if someone laser cut a pencil to sharpen it.

Note: So this thing can write, huh? Also, the dates and events from the past seem to be correct. How long does this thing exist? - Dr. Leon.

Test 914-0929
Name: Researcher Graymont
Date: 19/07/2019
Input: A large grandfather wooden frame weighing 30kg with all the inner workings removed, 70kg of hardened steel, various broken computer components totalling 9kg, one broken analog display weighing 300g

Note: Going for a clockwork-computer hybrid for this test - Graymont

Input: Above mentioned
Setting: Fine
Output: Same clock, but the pendulum is a miniature analog display that displays unknown symbols. The clock runs at exactly half of normal speed and seems to make nearby objects undergo move and react at half speed. The range of the effect varies, but the maximum observed was 3 meters while the minimum was 1 meter.

Note: Taking apart the clock disables its effect, but of note is that the clocks' gears have been almost perfectly replaced. The only exception being a new compartment of gears, which are attached to the analog pendulum. It is believed that the unknown symbols, along with the mystery gears are the cause for the time-altering effects.

Name: Senior Researcher Vivic, D-11847
Date: 20/07/2019
Total Items: Three 3D printed pizzas, measuring 25cm in diameter

Input: One of the above pizzas
Setting: 1:1
Output: A 15cm solid plastic model of MarioTM, NintendoTM.

Input: One of the above pizzas
Setting: Fine
Output: A 3D plastic model of a pineapple pizza similar to input.

Note: I really don't like what 914 is implying with this — Researcher Vivic

Input: The last output.
Setting: Fine
Output: A 3D plastic model of a meat lovers pizza similar to input.

Note: Now this is much better, even if it's plastic. — Researcher Vivic

Input: Last Original 3D printed pizza
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A large freshly baked pre-sliced cheese pizza that looks extremely delicious A circular plastic disk sliced like a pizza with a visual Cognitohazard that convinces anyone who sees it in one piece that it is in fact a real pizza, the affect lasts 1 hour after exposure, D-11847 restrained by security and returned to cell.

Test 914-0931
Name: Researcher Natasha
Date: 20/17/2019
Total Items: Two clocks and one note reading "68DZ"

Input: One clock and the above note
Setting: Fine
Output: A clock with 4 buttons on its side. When the buttons are pushed, it converts the time to a different numerical base. Determined after testing to have Senary, Octal, Decimal and Dozenal as the four options.

Test 914-0932
Name: Dr. Steph
Date: 20/07/2019
Total items: Three separate notes, all containing a different phrase.

Note: I know it's a machine, but I feel like I should introduce myself to it. And before you ask, no, I am not under any anomalous effects; people have done this before. -Dr. Steph

Input: A note that says "Hello 914, I'm Dr. Steph. It's nice to meet you!"
Setting: 1:1
Output: An origami butterfly.

Note: I expected something else. Might as well keep going. -Dr. Steph

Input: One note that says "I hope that we can conduct some great tests in the near future."
Setting: 1:1
Output: An origami clock. Ticking can be heard from the paper, although it cannot be recorded. Presumed to be a cognitohazard. Incinerated.

Input: One note that says "I would also like to apologize for not introducing myself earlier."
Setting: 1:1
Output: The same note that was inserted, but upon viewing, causes the reader to immediately apologize to SCP-914 for something that they did. The note was incinerated by security.

Note: That still went better than expected. - Dr. Steph

Test 914-0933
Name: Researcher Laskenta; D-19232
Date: 22/07/2019
Total Items: One sheet of paper, containing the full documentation of SCP-000 one flash-drive, containing the full documentation of SCP-000.
What is that?
Input: The sheet of paper
Setting: 1:1
Output: A sheet of paper, containing a detailed explanation of array indices, claiming that all arrays should start at negative fourteen (-14).
What did it say?
Note: The article is well written and defends its point of view very well. -Laskenta
Is it gone?

Input: The flash-drive
Setting: 1:1
Output: The same flash-drive. It only contains coordinates of a place in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. An exploration team has been sent to the postion to acquire information. As soon as the team arrived, the coordinates changed to another place within the Pacific Ocean. This procedure was repeated four times. Researcher Laskenta hypothesizes that the coordinates always point to an area without anything of relevance, effectively representing a geographic null pointer. Result has been placed in anomalous storage.
DID YOU COME ONLY TO LEAVE?

Test 914-0934
Name: Dr. Greene
Date: 23/07/2019
Total Items: One metal claw hammer, heavily rusted and one can of [REDACTED] brand rust remover.

Note: I wanted to see if 914 can repair objects. This hammer was discarded a while ago, so I decided to put it to use. -Dr. Greene

Input: Hammer, rust remover
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One model car. When observed, the metal appears to shift between completely rust-free and heavily rusted. If a section of the car is seperated, it still retains its form shifting properties.

Test 914-0935
Name: Junior Researcher McLaif, D-17205
Date: 23/07/2019
Total Items: Five 1-liter graduated glass flasks of distilled water

Input: One flask
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of finely crushed glass and paint dissolved in a puddle of water.

Input: One flask
Setting: Coarse
Output: One unmarked 1-liter flask, approximately 0.5 mL of paint, and 1 L of water shaped as a flask. When the output booth was opened, the water lost its shape and spread out on the floor of the booth.

Second test of the day and already I need a change of socks. To be fair, I don't know what I expected experimenting on water with 914. - Junior Researcher McLaif

Input: One flask
Setting: 1:1
Output: One 1-liter graduated cylinder made of ice containing a mixture of molten and solid glass.

Looks like 914 transferred the energy of the water into the glass. Though it was a little difficult cleaning up the glass stuck to the floor… - Junior Researcher McLaif

Input: One flask
Setting: Fine
Output: A miniature glass statue of Auguste Rodin's The Thinker, filled with 1 liter of water at 1:7.20 scale. Contains a mild cognitohazard where the viewer feels compelled to sit down and think of their previous action. Effect lasts for approximately 17 minutes after viewing. Placed in anomalous storage.

Input: One flask
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A perfectly smooth cube of a transparent material measuring 17.2 cm per side. Upon opening the output booth, the cube began expelling an unknown gas and began shrinking at a rate of 1 cm3/sec. This sublimation made retrieving the cube difficult, as the heat created by friction between the cube and D-17205's glove increased the gas produced under that area. Later analysis showed that the gas was a mixture of unusually cold water vapor and very fine glass particles, and the cube made of a water-silicon dioxide cubic structure. The cube does not sublime at temperatures below 200 degrees Kelvin.

Update: The gas has an anomalous effect of condensing water vapor in the air onto any material it contacts approximately 7 hours after contact. The effect lasts for about 2 hours.

I was wondering why my lab coat was unusually wet when I came into my office this morning. At least the security footage captured when it started dripping on the floor. - Junior Researcher McLaif

Test 914-0936
Name: Junior Researcher Lenna S. Thayer
Date: 23/07/2019
Total Items: Two SanDisk solid-state drives for desktop computers, all containing video files of all episodes of all four Tamagotchi! (2009-2015) series.

Input: A SanDisk solid-state drive with 1 terabyte of space, containing video files of all the episodes of all four Tamagotchi! (2009-2015) series including Yume Kira Dream, Miracle Friends, and GO-GO Tamagotchi!.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A seemingly-unchanged SanDisk solid-state drive except for the files, containing .webm files of hundreds of Abkhaz-dubbed anime Waga Shima de Oni Party! episodes, but the anime series is not released nor has it ever existed. This drive also contained exactly three hundred .mp3 duplicates of a song Hey Jude by the Beatles but all played in reverse and having unique filenames.

Input: A SanDisk solid-state drive with 1 terabyte of space and contained files duplicated from the first drive before refining.
Setting: Fine
Output: A Kingston solid-state drive with exactly 900,488,372,224 (2×1012−240) bytes of space, containing the following files: twenty screenshots of the first episode of Kira Kira ★ Happy Hirake! Cocotama, .mp4 files of the first 25 episodes of Tamagotchi! Miracle Friends with Gipuzkoan Basque subtitles, and a game named King Lokria's Modern War seemingly similar to Wolfenstein with its source code mainly coded in an assembly language. 90 minutes after installing the drive, the researcher has discovered an Easter egg of the game, which repeats a song Sola by Luis Fonsi but transposed up three quarter tones. With the exception of the case, the drive's temperature is kept constant within the range of 93 to 144 Kelvin regardless of the external temperature.

Note: Effortlessly avoided even mild frostbite on my hands. It's not a significantly flawed experiment. Finishing this, I requested the transfer of both drives to Site-15 for storage due to the lack of any serious errors and injuries encountered during testing. Recently, unfortunately, a senior researcher at Site-15 has deleted all the Hey Jude files due to an unexplained generation loss that rendered the files corrupted. - Lenna S. Thayer

Test 914-0937
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 23/07/2019
Total Items: One 1m by 1.5m map of the Pearl River Delta in southern China (Published by [REDACTED], a Hong Kong publisher), one 2m by 3m flag of the German Democratic Republic

Input: Map of the Pearl River Delta
Setting: Fine
Output: A map of the aforementioned area, published by a Denver-based Foundation front company. Nuclear strikes are marked in Panyu, Guangzhou; near Daya Bay, Shenzhen; and Yuen Long, Hong Kong. Context unknown.

Input: Flag of East Germany
Setting: Fine
Output: A map of the "Union of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, and Silesia", with its western border at the Elbe River, and its eastern border at the Oder and Eastern Neisse Rivers. While not anomalous, no such nation exists or existed.

Test 914-0938
Name: Doctor Mayo, D-39274
Date: 23/07/2019
Total Items: One bottle of [REDACTED] brand glass and steel cleaner, one bottle of [REDACTED] screen cleaner and one can of [REDACTED] brand compressed air.

Note: All of my previous tests have been fairly structured with a set of identical inputs on all five settings. I'm specifically going for very fine upgrades of typical cleaning products to see if 914 will do what it has in the past and produce useful outputs. - Doctor Mayo

Input: One bottle of [REDACTED] brand glass and steel cleaner
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One bottle of "914 brand clear view glass and steel cleaner". The output when used will cause any steel/metallic surfaces to become completely reflective as though observing a mirror.
When used on glass, it causes the glass to be completely transparent. Any attempt to sully the surfaces of the affected materials is met with failure and is immediately reflected upon the user. The bottle and the liquid has been disposed of.

Note: When D-39274 attempted to use a permanent marker on the glass after a few minutes of using various markers turned to face me with their front and face completely covered in overlapping lines and drawings. I was planning to have them attempt to break the glass and cut the steel slips but as it would most likely result in the death of D-39274 before the experiments are concluded I will come back once the testing is completed. - Doctor Mayo

Note: I will be skipping the test with the screen cleaner as I only have Foundation monitors to test with to avoid any possible damage to the equipment, as I think it may provide a similar output to the glass cleaner. - Doctor Mayo

Input: One can of [REDACTED] brand compressed air
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One "914 brand air cannon". The can reads: "A cannon in a can, air the nozzle at the offending dirt and watch it be blown away" The plastic straw used for the normal airflow has been shortened and widened to 5cm in diameter. The testing area was cleared apart from D-39274 who was instructed to fire at a target set up across the room. When D-39274 fired they were visibly blown backwards and the air pressure in the room was recorded at 12.79 PSI. When the can was retrieved from the remains of D-39274 it was found to still be weighted as though it could be used more than once. The can has been put into secure storage and the maintenance team are working to remove the embedded target fragments from the wall.

Note: As the final test resulted in the death of D-39274, I will not be completing the test of destroying the glass and steel slips used in the first set of testing, and placing them into anomalous storage. - Doctor Mayo

Test 914-0939
Name: Junior Researcher Kai, D-37610
Date: 23/07/2019
Total Items: One plastic perfume bottle, labelled as containing a home-made pepper spray, five glass tumblers

Note: For those who are interested in non-lethal self-defence, the recipe is as follows:
Mix 15g of propylene glycol dicaprylate with 15g propane-1,2,3-triyl tris(2-ethylhexanoate) and add 1g of distilled water. Point and spray.
Input: One bottle of Kai's pepper spray
Setting: 1:1
Output: Unchanged bottle, now labelled as containing "Dar-Be-Gone", which upon initial analysis appeared to have a similar chemical composition to most insecticides.

Note: Confiscated by Dr. Veritas. - Kai

Input: Five glass tumblers
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Five glass spheres capable of anomalous locomotion, neutralised

Note: When the booth opened, D-37610 reported seeing five glass spheres that appeared visually similar to translucent marbles. They rolled out of the booth before D-37610 could react and cracked once hitting the ground, stopping all movement. On a side note, that was a pretty good pun. - Junior Researcher Kai

Test 914-0940
Name: Junior Researcher Griffith
Date: 24/07/2019
Total Items: Five lead glass wine glasses

Note: I have heard of the damage some of the outputs from 914 can cause. Hopefully, something simple will avoid that, because I'd rather not die on my first day here. - Junior Researcher Griffith

Input: One wine glass
Setting: Rough
Output: A melted pile of slag and a small cloud of fluorine gas which dissipated upon opening of the output chamber

Note: First input and nothing bad has occurred. Off to a good start. - Junior Researcher Griffith

Input: One wine glass
Setting: Coarse
Output: Piles of 1 cm3 cubes, arranged by the type of compounds used in the leaded glass. Most of them crumbled upon retrieval.

Input: One wine glass
Setting: 1:1
Output: One scotch glass

Note: Everything seems to be normal, albeit a bit dull. Maybe I shouldn't have said that. - Junior Researcher Griffith
Input: One wine glass
Setting: Fine
Output: One crystal flute. When played the flute is tuned to an operatic soprano vocalist. The pitch was even throughout playing but at E6, the flute shattered.

Note: The note I played must have been at the right resonant tone for it to shatter. Interesting. - Junior Researcher Griffith

Input: One wine glass
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small glass sphere, covered in faceting similar to that of the original crystal wine glass with a diameter of 8cm. Holding the sphere causes a sudden onset of lead poisoning symptoms, including abdominal pain, loss of concentration, dizziness, and fatigue. The symptoms gradually escalate depending on extended physical contact. After releasing the output, symptoms dissipate in 60 minutes. Gloves are noted to minimize the symptoms. Output placed in anomalous storage.

Note: Well, my first round of testing didn’t result in any deaths of any personnel, so I’d say that calls for a toast. When I find another set of crystalware. - Junior Researcher Griffith

Note: She actually survived! Welcome to the team, Griffith. - Junior Researcher Kai

Test 914-0941
Name: Researcher Dan
Date: 24/07/2019
Total Items: One airline ticket for Researcher Dan to Hawaii, seven blank airline tickets

Note: This is not duplication for personal gain, it's merely a work field trip for the broke - Researcher Dan

Input: Above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Several small economy airline ticket from Site ██ for Researcher Darby. When Researcher Dan attempted retrieval they folded into paper airplane's reminiscent to C-130's and attempted to escape containment. Four were captured by staff, two were shot by onsite weapons, namely the H20-9000, and one escaped retrieval by entering the air vents and has presumably escaped.

Test 914-0942
Name: Researcher Laskenta; D-19232
Date: 26/07/2019
Total Items: Three white Gömböc

Input: One Gömböc
Setting: 1:1
Output: A white roly-poly toy, with a higher-than-normal centre of mass, rendering it useless for its purpose.

Input: One Gömböc
Setting: Fine
Output: A body with no stable point of equilibrium. It has yet to be proven if the output is anomalous or calculable by normal means.

Note: It is not possible to use the output as an infinite energy source, as it comes to halt as soon as anything other then the ground touches it.

Input: One Gömböc
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A sphere, with the same diameter of the input. Upon being touched by organic matter a human, every application of kinetic force and the constant force due to gravity is transferred to the sphere, causing it to move towards the centre of the mass of the subject. D-19232, who tried to remove the sphere by himself after touching the output, suffered severe internal damage and blood loss after it penetrated their skin and flesh. Upon D-19232s death, the effect ceased and the sphere was contained in a wooden box.

Test 914-0943
Name: Junior Researcher Kai
Date: 28/07/2019
Total Items: Two boxes of parts from identical disassembled mechanical watches of ███████ brand

Note: Testing the probability of possibly getting useful things out of 914. - Kai

Input: One box of parts
Setting: 1:1
Output: One box of parts, forming a miniature alarm clock after being assembled

Input: One box of parts
Setting: 1:1
Output: One miniature sundial fused together from the inputted parts, containing a minor cognitohazard that causes the wearer to insist that it tells the time as well as any mechanical watch

Note: I thought that was embarrassing, but I'm apparently anomalously able to tell the time accurately just by looking down at the sundial, even while indoors. Request to keep it? -Kai

Note: Granted. - Veritas

Test 914-0944
Name: Junior Researcher Kai
Date: 29/07/2019
Total Items: Six standard-issue analogue Foundation alarm clocks, taken liberated from rooms of various researcher personnel

Input: One alarm clock
Setting: Fine
Output: One “Bloody Mary” cocktail in a metal cup. Spectrometry shows that it is made from a suspension of various metal salts in the electrolyte from the battery included in the alarm clock and is therefore, unfit for consumption.

Note: I’m removing the batteries for the next few tests. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: One alarm clock, battery removed
Setting: Fine
Output: One “914 Brand Al-ion” battery, size “CCC”. Original battery noted to be Li-ion and of AAA size. As no such battery exists, it is currently under reverse-engineering.

Input: One alarm clock, battery removed
Setting: Fine
Output: One alarm clock, deemed to be sentient after vocalising repeatedly through anomalous means and demanding to be “placed into service” as soon as possible. Initially slightly damaged from Junior Researcher Kai’s dropping it on the floor after its initial vocalisation but irreparably damaged after being kicked across the testing chamber. Vocalisations have ceased and clock incinerated.

Input: One alarm clock, battery removed
Setting: Fine
Output: One mechanical pencil, determined to be non-anomalous after testing

Note: No. I am not touching that. I don’t care what the lab staff say about whether it’s safe or not, I am never going to touch it. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: One alarm clock, battery removed
Setting: Fine
Output: One wind-up music box, with a silent winding time of exactly 9 hours no matter how many times the handle is turned and plays the same alarm tune as the inputted clock after the music box winds down

Note: Perhaps 914 is telling us extremely stressed researchers about the importance of sufficient sleep. That said, may I extend my sleeping time to 9 hours from 8? - Junior Researcher Kai

Note: It's not my problem you spend more time watching Friends than sleeping at night. Manage your free time properly. - Veritas

Input: One alarm clock, battery removed
Setting: Fine
Output: One alarm clock, determined to shoot small pieces of metal removed from its internal mechanisms when the alarm is set. Ran out of ammunition after the entire internal circuitry was removed, but continued to function as a working clock despite having been almost entirely hollowed on the interior. Transferred to anomalous storage.

Input: Five AAA Li-ion batteries, removed from alarm clocks
Setting: Fine
Output: Five “914 Brand Al-ion” batteries, size “BBB”. Batteries are noted to be smaller than the “CCC” battery obtained earlier. As no such batteries exist, they are currently under reverse-engineering.

Test 914-0945
Name: Junior Researcher Kai
Date: 30/07/2019
Total Items: One paper-bag of exhaled air

Input: Bag of air
Setting: Fine
Output: Unchanged bag of air and a tiny pile of soot, air determined to have higher oxygen content but with lower water vapour content

Note: 914 might be useful if we experience a containment breach of an airborne SCP and the air recycling system fails. - Junior Researcher Kai

Note: Unpredictable outcomes mean that it's just as likely to make things worse. Wouldn't recommend. - Veritas

Test 914-0946
Name: Researcher Laskenta; D-40049
Date: 30/07/2019
Total Items: 3 standard "Facility 19-23" SCP Foundation PCs (without any data outside of the operating system)

Input: One PC
Setting: Fine
Output: A "Site 23 Facility 19 PCs Foundation SCP" (ID: 000112339aCCLPPSs-----). Item is identical to the input, with the exception of transposed words and letters within the system which can not be reverted or changed by any means. These include: "SCP os" → "soS PC"; "Session will be terminated by external server after 5 minutes of inactivity." → "Terminated server will, after 5 minutes, be, by inactivity of external session." All commands can be used as normal. If any part of the result is removed and used in another machine, the effects will also show upon starting the object. The effects cease after removing the used part and stopping the machine.

Note: I was going to melt the output down, but Junior Researcher Drant showed interest in the output. -Laskenta

I am requesting advanced tests under my supervision, to acquire more information about the transmission of anomalous effects, particularly when using parts that do normally not affect the function of a machine at all, for example, a screw in a computer. -Simon Drant, JR

Input: One PC
Setting: Fine
Output: A metal plate (1x1.2m) with small elevations on one side. These elevations run around the plate in curved lines. On areas with no elevation are green plastic figurines, allegorising trees and bushes. Small parts of the elevations glow in a faint yellow light, which move around on the elevation in an alternating speed. The source of the light and their movement is unknown and theorized to be anomalous. The lights intensity decreases slowly over time, too slow for the human eye. If the constant speed of recession does not change, all lights will cease within 21 years.

Input: One PC
Setting: Fine
Output: Seven identical metallic objects reassembling mobile phones. Each device has a seventh of every component from the input. None of the devices work, as no component is properly connected. The result cannot be used and is non-anomalous.

Note: I tried to make PCs better; I got mobile devices and they do not work. That's pretty much my impression about technological history. I will keep one. - Laskenta

Note: You're not keeping anything until they are thoroughly screened for anomalous viruses. Pick them up at anomalous storage if Rosen permits it. - Veritas

Test 914-0947
Name: Researcher Laskenta; D-40049
Date: 31/07/2019
Total Items: Three colourless magic cubes (3x3x3)

Input: One cube
Setting: 1:1
Output: The same cube. The inspection has shown that the cube has been scrambled.

Input: One cube
Setting: Fine
Output: A "ghost cube". While not having any colour, the size and form of the faces differ.

Note: Please note that a ghost cube is not incorporeal, but an existing puzzle. -Laskenta

Input: One cube
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small round plate with four wheels and four buttons which span to both sides of the object. Upon turning the wheels, the short hand of the next 18 clocks (analogue & digital) move in the same fashion as the clocks on a Rubik's Clock would. Additionally, everybody but the user of the output in the same room as an affected clock will tell the time as shown on the clock, even when the subject has not looked at the clock. Subjects will be oblivious to every change on the clock and will state that they "said the same time one minute ago". When two affected clocks are in the same room, subjects will feel nauseous and have a strong urge to leave the room, or move all but one clock to another room.

Addendum: Researcher Laskenta solved the puzzle at 2:52 am (18:52 UTC). Upon solving, the output revealed a cognitohazard on both sides which granted the solver the ability to set all clocks within the same room as the solver to a time they had spoken. This change has the same effect as the change of the test result has. Both the ability and the cognitohazard ceased after exactly 18 hours and 52 minutes.

Note: I also solved the puzzle at 19:37 and 05:19 UTC both resulting in the same effect which lasted for 19 hours 37 minutes and 5 hours 19 minutes respectively. -Laskenta

Test 914-0948
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 31/07/2019
Total Items: Two standard 3x3x3 [REDACTED]'s Cube puzzles, two "interlocking ring" puzzles consisting of three rings apiece.

Note: I wanted to test 914's problem-solving skills. See if it solves these in the proper method, solves them in a completely improper method, or, as I'm guessing will be most likely, doesn't solve them at all. -Prof. Wren

Input: A cube.
Setting: Fine
Output: A 5x5x5 cube puzzle. The colored stickers now have moving imagery on them instead. Upon solving the cube, the images are revealed to be a 3D rendering of the inside of a mechanical clock, with one side showing a clock face. The time shown on the clock matches the current time in Hungary, where the [REDACTED] was invented.

Input: A cube.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A 3x3x3x3 tesseract puzzle. Object has been placed in storage due to its 4-dimensional nature being a natural visual and cognitive hazard; site director approval required for experimentation with the object.

Note: Just looking at that thing made my brain hurt. At least the clock was neat. -Prof. Wren

Input: A ring puzzle
Setting: Fine
Output: The same 3-ring puzzle, but the rings have been reshaped into the SCP Foundation's logo.

Input: A ring puzzle
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Three rings, separated. Attempting to reconnect them to "reset" the puzzle results in the rings momentarily becoming intangible, falling through each other and whatever is holding them before landing on the floor, fully separated once again.

Note: Well, that's certainly one way to solve such a puzzle, I guess… -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0949
Name: Dr. Sappho
Date: 01/08/2019
Total Items: Three handmade 6-month calendars for 2018 (Jan-Jun, Jul-Dec) and 2019 (Jan-Jun).
Note: I haven't thrown these out yet because they were gifts from the site psychiatrist a few years ago. I'd hate to just throw them out; the sweetheart worked rather hard on these.- Dr. Sappho

Note: Sappho is here visiting from Lunar Base ██. Every once in a while, they assign the base's workers to a mission here - Terra Firma - to counteract the negative effects of being in zero gravity for too long. We believe this may have skewed the results from 914. - Dr. Ira

Input: Jan-Jun 2018 calendar
Setting: 1:1
Output: The lyrics for Rocket Man by Elton John. Extra sheets of paper were folded neatly next to the lyrics.

Input: Jul-Dec 2018 calendar
Setting: Fine
Output: Lunar Calendar for 2███. Of note are several dates marked in red sharpie for 'Congealment Dates' as referred to by a key. The standard Foundation logos are present in the bottom left corner of every page. Result was sent to the Temporal Anomalies division for storage.

Input: Jan-Jun 2019 calendar
Setting: Very Fine
Output: D-2240 was ordered to remove the completed calendar 15 minutes after the process completed. All images on the top portion of the calendar, the calendar's dates and month arrangement are now moving images caused by the ink on the pages moving around the pages. D-2240 expressed that the ink would avoid her hands as much as possible, pooling at the edges of the pages.

Attempts to add ink to the pages have resulted in this being added to its total mass, giving it more ink to arrange on the page. D-2240 was asked to write down an important date on a random page of the calendar. D-2240 wrote down her wife's birthday. The ink moved off the page, and the date was filled in as appropriate automatically. When the date passed, the ink joined the upper page, animating along with the rest of the photo.

Note: Requesting to keep the output of this last result. Dr. Sapphos

Note: Make sure you can handle it, then make sure someone knows. You're new, but I don't think that'll stop Veritas from coming after you for requesting so. Dr. Ira

Note: Keep it, but let me know if it starts predicting the apocalypse or something. Hackett would be mad if I didn't let him know. - Veritas.

Test 914-0950
Name: Junior Researcher Kai, D-23191
Date: 02/08/2019
Total Items: Nine stacks of foolscap folio (sixty pages per stack), one broomstick and dustpan set

Input: Nine stacks of foolscap folio
Setting: 1:1
Output: Three and a half stacks of B3 paper

Note: Not quite what I was looking for. - Kai

Input: Three and a half stacks of B3 paper
Setting: 1:1
Output: Eight stacks of letter paper

Input: Eight stacks of letter paper
Setting: 1:1
Output: Four stacks of A3+ paper

Note: British to American? That's interesting. - Kai

Input: Four stacks of A3+ paper
Setting: 1:1
Output: Six and a half stacks of Shirokuban Large-size paper

Japanese now? I should have kept my mouth shut. - Kai

Input: Six and a half stacks of Shirokuban Large-size paper
Setting: 1:1
Output: Two and a half stacks of A2 paper

Note: Thanks 914, I'll take what I can get. Anyone who is free can help to cut it. After the lab staff have made sure it's safe, of course. - Kai

Input: One broomstick and dustpan set
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One wood-plastic contraption visually similar to a vacuum cleaner without a dust bag. When D-23191 picked it up, he gained the ability to twirl the contraption, using his hands, with ease and began to sweep the floor of the testing chamber while spinning it with a single hand. However, D-23191 was unable to sustain the action for more than four minutes before dropping the contraption from exhaustion. The swept areas on the floor were noted to be cleaned of stains that would normally require chemical washing. After a period of five minutes, testing continued with a regular broomstick for comparison, but D-23191 was not able to twirl the regular broomstick in the same fashion as the output.

Note: I would say that's… somewhat useful, but only if you have superhuman endurance. Incinerated. - Kai

Test 914-0951
Name: Junior Researcher Kai
Date: 06/08/2019
Total Items: One disassembled miniature pinball machine.

Input: One disassembled table pinball machine
Setting: Fine
Output: One figurine composed of plastic and wood, appearing to hold a billiards cue, determined to be non-anomalous after testing.

Test 914-0952
Name: Researcher Laskenta; D-40049
Date: 09/08/2019
Total Items: Four table tennis bats; Two table tennis balls

Note: Junior Researcher Kai and I were talking about table tennis and the physical performance of its players the other day, hence the input of this test. -Laskenta

Input: Two table tennis bats; One table tennis ball
Setting: 1:1
Output: A figure representing a plump generic Chiroptera (bat) mostly made out of wood with chunks of celluloid.

Note: If one instance of SCP-504 were to be placed between me, the last test result, and SCP-914, could it even choose? -Laskenta

Input: Two table tennis bats; One table tennis ball
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The same two bats, small missing pieces of red paint. The ball has been coloured with the paint of the bats to represent a tomato. Upon opening the output chamber, all items slowly floated to the center of the room to start a match of table tennis. The ball ricocheted between the bats and where a ping-pong table would have stood; the bats flew around as if they where held by two humanoid players with unnaturally high speed, strength, and constitution. The speed of the ball reached a peak of ~245km/h. After 46 minutes and 33 seconds the match ended with the ball being shot in the direction of the security camera with a speed of ~220km/h. This resulted in the total destruction of the ball and the armoured camera. The bats fell directly to the ground after the ball was destroyed. Results held no anomalous features afterwards.

Note to Dr. Veritas: My last pay check and the bill, which already went through accounting, lies on your desk at top of the second "Accidents" pile. -Laskenta

Test 914-0953
Name: Researcher Carter W.
Date: 10/08/2019
Total Items: Four metronomes

I've been out of commission for the summer due to a family visit in Italy. I got a souvenir for you, Veritas - a bottle of wine! I figured you might need it due to the antics of Darby and the others. -Carter

Input: One metronome
Setting: Coarse
Output: One metronome needle, numerous gears, and about 0.5 kg of wood.

Input: One metronome
Setting: 1:1
Output: One metronome, with the maximum b.p.m. (beats per minute) being 224 rather than 220.

Input: One metronome
Setting: Fine
Output: One metronome, with the anomalous effect of making anyone within 3 meters of it walk in perfect unison with the set beat. This also affects heartbeat. When the dial was turned to 220, the D-Class told to change the bpm suffered cardiac arrest after suffering from tachycardia and was rushed to the infirmary, where he was resuscitated.

Note: Was I in that staff picture with all the weird stuff, Lunar? The one that predicted the, er, loss of Erickson? -Carter

Suggested Note: I have no idea, I'll need to find it. -Intern Lunar

Test 914-0954
Name: Assistant Researcher Takahashi
Date: 10/08/2019
Total Items: Three vinyl records of varying artists

Input: The first album, Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road
Setting: Coarse
Output: A pile of ground up polyvinyl chloride.

Note: I don't know what I expected. Of course it was gonna do this. - Assistant Researcher Takahashi

Input: The second album, Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin IV
Setting: 1:1
Output: Seemingly unchanged album of Led Zeppelin IV, but the vocals are all spoken words. The instrumentals stayed the same, however.

Note: Hearing Stairway to Heaven spoken is a weird experience. I don't know how to describe it perfectly, but I guess it's like… a lukewarm shower. - Assistant Researcher Takahashi

Input: The third album, Queen's A Night At The Opera.
Setting: Fine
Output: Seemingly unchanged album of A Night At The Opera with the anomalous effect of causing anyone within a 7-meter radius to repeatedly ram their heads on the closest surface during Bohemian Rhapsody's hard rock section. Researchers within its radius began to complain about sore necks and headaches.

Note: I almost threw up after writing this. I don't know whether to incinerate this or keep it to prank people, but I am NEVER doing that again when I'm within this thing's radius. - Assistant Researcher Takahashi

Note: I was passing through the hallway when I heard Bohemian Rhapsody and decided to sing along. Then, I got the worst case of whiplash the medical team has ever seen throughout their tenure at this Facility. If I ever get my hands on that vinyl when I'm back from medical leave in a week, I will give your room an SCP classification with that played on loop. - Junior Researcher Kai

Test 914-0955
Name: Researcher Miniwa
Date: 12/08/2019
Total Items: 15cm×23cm book of general physics. Contains information on various branches and laws of physics, including those which are fully understood (e.g. kinematics) to those which are still being researched. (e.g. quantum mechanics).

Input: Above book
Setting: 1:1
Output: 15cm×23cm book of jokes, mostly physics-related and from a variety of time periods. No limits have been found to the type of joke, and samples are included below:

Isaac Newton: slaps roof of car
Car: slaps Isaac Newton

Never trust an atom.
Why?
They make up everything.

Test 914-0956
Name: Prof. Wren
Date: 13/08/2019
Total Items: Five pachinko machines, each carrying a load of 100 pachinko balls.

Note: The things people put on eBay these days. -Prof. Wren

Input: A pachinko machine.
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of smashed pachinko machine parts, including a pile of molten metal consistent with the materials used in pachinko balls.

Input: A pachinko machine.
Setting: Coarse
Output: A fully disassembled pachinko machine, including a hopper full of pachinko balls.

Input: A pachinko machine.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A pachinko-themed pinball machine. One game costs 100¥. The pachinko balls have been merged into 12 pinballs, visible in a dispenser tube at the top of the game.

Note: Well, the money requirement makes keeping this in our break room kind of a non-deal. Perhaps we should transfer this to where that weird vending machine is kept? -Prof. Wren

Input: A pachinko machine.
Setting: Fine
Output: A pachinko machine with an altered layout. No anomalous properties detected.

Note: Wait…That's it? -Prof. Wren

Input: A pachinko machine.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A disc-shaped pachinko machine, hovering at a distance of 0.2m to 0.24m above the ground. Game operates without need for electricity. The game is played by inserting a pachinko ball into the top and then rotating the disc clockwise or counterclockwise to maneuver the ball through various obstacles to reach the center.

Note: Okay, now this is fun. -Prof. Wren

Test 914-0957
Name: Dr. Steph
Date: 16/08/2019
Total Items: One cardboard box, 30cm long, 20cm wide, and 25cm high, with a note attached that reads "Schrödinger's cat."

Input: The aformentioned items
Setting: Fine
Output: A cardboard origami cat, with the same mass as the inserted box. Note is crumpled up next to the cat. When picked up, it has a 50% chance of instantly killing the person who touched it via cardiac arrest. The cardboard cat killed two guards, but left Dr. Steph alive. Item was collected by D-Class personnel and later incinerated.

Note: Dr. Steph is temporarily suspended for gross incompetence, and has 14 days to think about what constitutes as a terrible testing idea. - Veritas.

Test 914-0958
Name: Junior Researcher Kai, D-46701, D-61483, D-17939 , D-24237
Date: 18/08/2019
Total Items: Three teabags (one Earl Grey, one Chamomile, one English Breakfast)

Input: Earl Grey teabag
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Leaf-shaped cloth with property of causing severe muscle cramps in individuals that come into contact with it via anomalous introduction of extreme levels of bergapten into the bloodstream.

Note: D-46701 and D-61483 rendered unable to continue testing, returned to D-class chambers. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: Chamomile teabag
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Unchanged teabag which gives an indefinite number of cups of tea made from it. Found to anomalously reduce drinkers' blood sugar levels by 30-40%.

Note: Upon drinking, the tea induced hypoglycaemia in D-17939, who has diabetes and had taken insulin an hour prior to the experiment. Currently in medical bay awaiting results of evaluation of health and ability to continue testing. We will continue with the final experiment for now. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: English Breakfast teabag
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A miniature replica of SCP-3560-J that attempted to attack D-24237 upon retrieval. Was destroyed by Security Personnel with water guns and resulted in multiple puddles of tea around the testing chamber.

Note: Ethical ramifications of using a sapient being as a teabag currently under debate by the Ethics Committee. - Junior Researcher Kai

Conclusion: I’m guessing that if 914 was an actual person, he or she wouldn’t be a big fan of tea. Also, I’m noting that tea-related experiments generally tend to result in high injury or fatality rates among testing personnel, especially if they are D-class. Recommending researchers to avoid similar tests for the next few weeks. - Junior Researcher Kai

Test 914-0959
Name: Researcher Laskenta; D-40049
Date: 19/08/2019
Total Items: Several damaged external memory devices

Note: Like last time, all used items belong to Foundation personnel, who asked me to retrieve their data. Since all data-recovery failed and the data is not important enough to use other anomalous machinery, I will use 914 as my very last attempt to get the files back. - Laskenta

Input: A Foundation optical storage (CD-ROM; 12cm; 900MiB), with two scratches on the readable side
Setting: Fine
Output: A 7cm wide cog made out of polycarbonate coated with aluminium. It jolts forward at irregular intervals at high speeds (estimated peak: 7.5m/s). The object repeats its pattern of jolting after 2048 jolts.

Note: I will set up a camera to record the pattern of sudden movements, as it might be a binary code that is repeated. -Laskenta

Addendum: After approximately 400 jolts, once recording began, the test result lunged itself with a speed of 7.5m/s into the recording camera and exploded. The only damaged items are the recording device and the output, which have been incinerated by the explosion. Result held no anomalous properties afterwards.

Note: My outputs seem to either like or hate recording devices so much they explode. Luckily that camera was bought by me. No need to go to accounting. -Laskenta

Input: A Foundation optical storage (CD-ROM; 12cm; 900MiB), with a single crack radiating outward from the centre, approximately 4cm long
Setting: Fine
Output: A Möbius loop, made out of polycarbonate coated with aluminium. An inspection with a microscope has showed that it holds "pits" and "lands" like a CD would. Any attempt to read the data will result in anomalously reaching an end of the Möbius loop, which can only be perceived by the reading device. This effect will activate after 32 bits are read, no matter where the recording starts. The 4 read bytes (32 bits) will always be "01000101 01001111 01000011 01000100", which can be read as "EOCD".

Input: A Foundation ID-Card (Guest clearance level 3, belonging to Dr. H████ D████████████), with a ripped magnetic strip and a functional microcircuit
Setting: Fine
Output: The input, with a microscopically small clockwork in the place of the microcircuit. Due to being directly connected to the card, the clockwork is not able to be turned, without either breaking the cogs, or ripping the card. The clockwork has no apparent input or output and putting it into motion would only result in every part to be moved. The result has no other changes and is non-anomalous.

Note: While every clockmaker would be impressed by its latest work, 914 has once again improved the object without achieving the desired result. That being said, I will test both remaining outputs again for any unknown features. -Laskenta

Date: 20/08/2019
Total Items: One ████ ███ brand blank sketchpad.

Note: Greetings everyone, I have recently been transferred here and will now perform my first test.

Input: The aforementioned item
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Darby's Misadventures in Site-19 Facility-23, Vol.1 comic book

Note: Looks like it went well. I'll perform more tests in the future if time wills. By any chance, does a certain "Darby" exist here? Also, I'm formally requesting Dr. Veritas to let me keep this book and reproduce it for everyone to read. - Researcher Vil

Note: Finally, some Darby-related reading material. Perhaps we could donate this to the break room and use excerpts for a "Things Not To Do At Site-19" guide? - Junior Researcher Kai

Note: Granted. - Veritas

Test 914-0961
Name: Junior Researcher Kai
Date: 20/08/2019
Total Items: Four tridents cast from bronze, one necklace pendant made of glass

Note: Managed to grab these at a garage sale. Perhaps it's just wishful thinking, but I really hope we can get something useful out of these. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: One trident
Setting: 1:1
Output: One bident, with the original central spike transferred to the bottom of the shaft

Input: One trident
Setting: 1:1
Output: One pike, with the original side spikes shifted by 90°

Note: So far so good. Let's move it up to Fine. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: One trident
Setting: Fine
Output: One trident, capable of firing spikes when swung

Note: Apparently, the spikes can be reattached. If we blunt them, this might actually be a really fun form of somewhat-safe recreation. Let's see what we can get with Very Fine. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: One trident
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One trident, capable of absorbing minute amounts of bioelectricity within the body and redirecting it as static electricity between the spikes

Note: One of the D-class who tested it tried to use too much of his own bioelectricity in an attempt to charge and attack the security personnel before suffering from cardiac arrest. This serves as a reminder that your heartbeat is partially controlled by bioelectricity. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: One glass pendant
Setting: Fine
Output: One glass chain, noted to be of extremely-high detail and currently unable to be reproduced by modern technology.

Test 914-0962
Name: Weapons Researcher Grizelle Markham
Date: 20/08/2019
Total Items: One Colt 1851 Navy Revolver with an SCP Foundation logo printed on the grip, one photo of Researcher Markham.

Input: Colt Revolver
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One IMI Desert Eagle pistol with the logo of the Global Occult Coalition printed on. Viewing the pistol causes the viewer to be aware of all information regarding of the United Nations and all of its affiliates.

Note: No, just no. I don't want to know what the WHO is doing with respect to Ebola. Nor the reason why the GOC decided on assaulting a Foundation lab in New Jersey on July 9, 1992. - Markham

Input: Photo of Researcher Markham
Setting: Fine
Output: A photo of Dr. Veritas and an unknown woman the Grizzly entity drinking Martinis in Inverness, Scotland. The photo, dated 15/07/2019, animates every four hours, detailing a conversation between the two. Researcher Markham is only visible during the last fourteen seconds of the conversation, ordering a glass of [REDACTED] brand whisky.

Note: Okay, I do love whisky myself, but who exactly is she? There's literally no record of whoever this is outside Facility 23. - Markham

Test 914-0963
Name: Junior Researcher McLaif, D-74652
Date: 21/08/2019
Total Items: One shuffled set of ██████-brand rotating puzzle cubes, ranging in size from 2x2 to 7x7.

Note: It has been observed in the past that 914 is capable of playing games such as chess. This test will focus on whether 914 can solve rotating puzzle cubes. -McLaif

Input: One 2x2 cube.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A solved cube.

Input: One 3x3 cube.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A shuffled █████-brand 3-layered pyramid rotation puzzle, commonly known as a Pyraminx. Successfully solved by D-74652.

Input: One 4x4 cube.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A solved cube with all edge pieces flipped. All attempts to completely solve the output cube have failed.

Note: 4x4 cubes and larger have edge parity, where a cube's edge piece is flipped from normal. It seems that 914 has picked up on this. And made this set of cubes forever unsolved. -McLaif

Input: One 5x5 cube.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A shuffled █████-brand dodecahedral rotation puzzle, also known as a Megaminx, with black stickers and colored pieces. The output puzzle is non-anomalous and solvable, but difficult due to the inverted colors.

Note: I had considered peeling off the stickers of the output, because it's essentially a stickerless cube/puzzle at this point. -McLaif

Note: 914 is currently at two unsolved and two solved outputs. This may just be due to 914's inherent unpredictability. It also seems that if 914 turns the puzzle into a different form, it does not solve it. This last puzzle will help determine if this is the case. -McLaif

Input: One 6x6 cube.
Setting: 1:1
Output: The unchanged input. A shuffled 6x6 bandaging rotating cube puzzle. Certain pieces on the cube, such as a conjoined pair of an edge piece and a corner piece, prevent the cube from rotating in certain directions. The bandaged pieces are shuffled and not solved, rendering the puzzle impossible to be 100% solved.

Note: I have placed all the outputs into the break room. Please note that the 4x4's edge pieces are unsolvable, and the 6x6 has a few unsolved, bandaged pieces. -McLaif

Test 914-0964
Name: Intern Walker
Date: 21/08/2019
Total Items: Three copies of SCP-914's file

Input: SCP-914's File
Setting: 1:1
Output: A file describing one 'Clockwork-chan'
The file describes a tall, Caucasian female with orange hair and red eyes. She has no booths, instead her mouth [DATA EXPUNGED]. She is described as being snarky, and playing pranks on the researchers that operate her. She is described to have a crush on Maintenance Technician Johnson, and enjoys torturing Researcher Darby, perhaps out of spite. The testing logs seem have remained the same, save for additional dialogue and [DATA EXPUNGED]

Furthermore, the character [DATA EXPUNGED]

Tests 2 and 3 were canceled with extreme prejudice by order of Dr. Veritas, Dr. Hackett and the Ethics Committee.

Notes from various personnel:

Note: I just read some of the testing logs. Yes, they are similar to the real logs, but it felt like I was reading [REDACTED] instead of an official foundation document. I think I'm going to enjoy burning this to ash. - Intern Walker

Note: I read through some of the logs in my free time. I'll be back after getting my hands on as many amnestics as possible. Afterwards, I'll join Walker in burning those cursed texts. - Dr. Steph

Note: I'll personally see to it that every trace of this is destroyed. Failure to cooperate in voluntary amnestic administration will result in termination. - Veritas

Note: I've already burned it, sir. I'll gladly take an amnestic, though. - Intern Walker

Test 914-0965
Name: Junior Researcher Kai, D-90313
Date: 21/08/2019
Total Items: Sixteen feather dusters of █████████ brand, one note with "Be creative!" written on it

Input: Sixteen feather dusters, one note
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One tightly-compressed ball of feathers and one equally-sized plastic sphere

Note: D-90313 picked up the ball of feathers and began laughing and shivering slightly. She later described the experience of being "tickled all over the body by feathers" while holding the ball. After picking up the plastic sphere, D-90313 yelled out loud and dropped the ball. When questioned, she claimed to have felt a "sudden hit from a cane-like object". I theorise that the two outputs are the cognitohazardous equivalents of the two non-standard functions of a feather duster - to tickle people with the feathers and to hit people with the handle. I honestly expected the spheres to explode or do something equally dangerous, not to get a tickle ball and a punish ball for children. I’m going to get some Tylenol now for the stress. On a related note, the feather ball has been donated to the break room for recreation purposes. - Junior Researcher Kai

Test 914-0966
Name: Researcher Laskenta; D-47565
Date: 21/08/2019
Total Items: A USB flash drive containing the source code and documentation of Java 8

Input: The flash drive
Setting: Fine
Output: The same flash drive. After physically connecting the result to a computer, all liquids within ten meters from it are replaced with ~303-313 Kelvin hot coffee. D-47565's blood, who plugged in the device, fell victim to this effect, causing massive internal bleeding. Subject survived and recovered within eight days. Medical examination is ongoing to ascertain how D-47565 can survive with non-anomalous coffee in their circulatory system. The flash drive is only accessible by a "Solaris 8" system and contains no data. Reading the bytes on a "Solaris 8" system results in pseudocode for replacing all liquids in the range of ten meters with coffee.

Test 914-0967
Name: WR Grizelle Markham
Date: 21/08/2019
Total Items: Three 5.56 NATO bullets, three notes reading "United States", "Indiana", and "556" respectively.

Input: One 5.56 NATO bullet, note reading "556"
Setting: Fine
Output: A miniature model of a Boeing 707-323C plane, of the same model as SCP-556, paint included. The output note is crumpled, and blank.

Input: One 5.56 NATO bullet, note reading "United States"
Setting: 1:1
Output: A 7.62 Soviet round, and a note reading "Советский Союз" ("Soviet Union" in Russian). Testing determined that the bullet is hollow, and whenever fired, will fly at the direction of the youngest person from any NATO member state, often damaging the gun used.

Input: One 5.56 NATO bullet, note reading "Indiana"
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Two items:

A metal plate. Engraved on it was an log describing an incident involving the SCP-1137 research team (including then-Indiana state senator Huey Joel Deckard), the Serpent's Hand, and the American Nazi Party on 19/05/1973.
A handwritten list of assets (mainly secure facilities and non-sapient SCPs) controlled by the Foundation. Those being frozen as indemnities are marked with the ISO 3166 code of 83 countries and territories, plus an unallocated code "JS" identifying Somaliland. The handwriting is consistent with that of SCP-134, and the Seal of Virginia is visible at the bottom.
The corresponding history where the incident happened led to the world experiencing an LK-class "Lifted Veil" scenario in the mid-2020s after a devastating war involving nuclear, chemical, and [REDACTED] weapons, and the global population being reduced to 4.8 billion. Due to their intense involvement in the war, the SCP Foundation, Global Occult Coalition, and Marshall, Carter and Dark filed for bankruptcy protection between 2030 and 2035.

Test 914-0968
Name: Dr. S. Matism and Guest Researcher D. Matism
Date: 23/08/2019
Items: 5 copies of Goldeneye 007 for N64

Note: This was my daughter's favorite game during her childhood, so she wanted to do something with it. I convinced Veritas to let her use 914 - Dr. Matism

Note: Settings Rough and Coarse have been removed for brevity.

Input: One copy of Goldeneye 007
Setting: 1:1
Output: One copy of MarioKart 64

Input: One copy of Goldeneye 007
Setting: Fine
Output: One copy of ''007: Tomorrow Never Dies'' for the Playstation 1 console.

Input: One copy of Goldeneye 007.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One watch made of aluminum, polycarbonate, and common plastic that is powered by an unknown source. When the watch is viewed by the wearer by raising their arm to eye level, reportedly, all surroundings cease movement. From the outside, the wearer is unresponsive and unable to be manipulated by any tools attempted so far. Notably, the watch is non-functional.

Note: Archived in anomalous object storage - Dr. Matism

Test 914-0969
Name: Dr. Zavalosa
Date: 26/08/2019
Total Items: One battery-operated radio boxes, two AA batteries

Note: I’ve been reading through the extensive test logs and I want to try something myself. - Dr Zavalosa

Input: One battery-operated radio box with two AA batteries inserted, the radio is turned on, with the current station playing an advertisement
Setting: Fine
Output: One box television, powered from an anomalous source, playing the same advertisement as the radio with added visuals One box television that can neither be turned off nor can be switched from the current channel in any way. Channel plays non-stop advertisements from an unknown source.

Note: The advertisement that was being played on the radio happened to be the irritatingly catchy "Down Down Prices Are Down!" ad by Coles. Perhaps in the refining process, the ad was an important quality to fixate on, or it focused on that because I myself was thinking about the irritating catchiness of the ad. This does give me an idea for further experiments, however. - Dr. Zavalosa

Note: Destroyed by firearm and subsequent incineration. - Veritas

Note: I'd like to remind personnel not to leave their results in testing areas. - Security Chief Sedna

- Hide 097X Test Logs
Test 914-0970
Name: Junior Researcher Kai
Date: 26/08/2019
Total Items: Three bottles of Class-A amnestics, three bottles of Class-B amnestics, three bottles of Class-C amnestics

Note: I managed to requisition the Class-C amnestics from the medical bay. Thanks, Dr. Veritas.

Input: One bottle of Class-A amnestic
Setting: 1:1
Output: One bottle of vodka, 55% ABV

NA symbol of my thanks, Dr. Veritas. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: One bottle of Class-A amnestic
Setting: Fine
Output: One bottle of amnestic, labelled "Ordo-α". Spectrometry gave inconclusive results and testing was evaluated to be not worth the risk. Output incinerated.

Input: One bottle of Class-A amnestic
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One empty bottle, surrounded by a fine mist of amnestic of unknown composition. Junior Researcher Kai attempted to pick up the bottle but failed repeatedly to complete the action. Output retrieved mechanically and incinerated.

What? I thought I was going to pick up the bottle? Why is it still in the booth? - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: One bottle of Class-B amnestic
Setting: 1:1
Output: One bottle of Class-Darby amnestic

This seems ominous. Someone please check where Researcher Darby is currently posted. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: One bottle of Class-B amnestic
Setting: Fine
Output: One syringe, made of the same plastic as the bottle and filled with unchanged Class-B amnestic. When the syringe is filled with any liquid, the contents are instantly converted via anomalous means to an equal volume of a suspension of Class-B amnestic in a third of the original liquid. Output incinerated.

That's useful, but not enough. I don't think the medical team can afford the time and resources to purify the amnestics obtained from it. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: One bottle of Class-B amnestic
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One Class-B amnestic of bottle One small tablet, determined to have a cognitohazard carved on both sides that induces hallucinations of all pill-shaped objects to be perceived as bottles of Class-B amnestics. Output incinerated.

Input: One bottle of Class-C amnestic
Setting: 1:1
Output: One bottle of vodka, 89% ABV

Donated to medical bay for sterilisation purposes. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: One bottle of Class-C amnestic
Setting: Fine
Output: One inanimate plastic statue. Later determined to attack any person within a four-metre radius that lies about something. Output incinerated after severe injuries [DATA EXPUNGED] personnel who shouted, "I'm not going to shoot it!" when it attempted [DATA EXPUNGED]

Input: One bottle of Class-C amnestic
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One torn page documenting the "Veritas Spell", found to be removed anomalously from SCP-239's "spell book". Upon discovery of this fact, both Site-19 and Site-17 were placed under lockdown and a thorough evaluation of SCP-239's containment procedures was made before it was determined to be SCP-914 that had somehow accessed Site-17's document archives. It is currently unknown how SCP-914 acquired the page, as the original "spell book" was destroyed in the aftermath [DATA EXPUNGED] and virtual access to the surviving copies is only available through the Site-17 intranet database.

A text copy of the page is available as inserted below:

Veritas Spell - Makes people tell the truth!
Simply say Veritas to someone and you will make the person very sleepy and willing to tell the truth! Careful, don't abuse it.

No more testing with amnestics. Not in a very long time. - Junior Researcher Kai

Test 914-0971
Name: Dr. Zavalosa
Date: 27/08/2019
Total Items: Three battery-operated radio boxes, six AA batteries

Input: One battery-operated radio box with two AA batteries inserted, the radio is on, currently playing an advertisement

Note: The experiment was suspended until the station moved on from advertisements to play “Old Town Road” by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus. - Dr. Zavalosa

Setting: Fine
Output: One Smart mini-fridge with no brand to speak of, powered from an anomalous source. The touch screen is unresponsive and plays the music video of “Old Town Road” on loop endlessly. The fridge does not appear to refrigerate anything placed within it. The fridge has been melted down with no further anomalies to report.

Input: One battery-operated radio box with two AA batteries inserted, the radio is on, currently playing assorted pop songs

Note: The experiment was suspended until the station moved on to an evening talk show program. - Dr. Zavalosa

Setting: Fine
Output: One transparent tinted sheet of plastic with copper filings encased within the plastic. The metal filings float within the plastic via anomalous means, creating an imitation of a news talk show. No audio can be heard coming from the talk show on the plastic. The sheet can be bent but cannot be damaged, the filings can be pushed around, but quickly corrects back into the imitation. Further analysis shows that the sheet is a real-time feed of the 24/7 Fox News talk show.

Note: While the medium where the content was displayed on has vastly changed, 914's refining process kept what is being played on the radio at the time. My theory regarding what the operator of SCP-914 is focusing on to be an important factor in the refining process now has more evidence to back it up. - Dr. Zavalosa

Note: The sheet has passed cognitohazard and memetic testing. I'm going to be leaving it in the break room in case someone wants to watch the 24/7 Fox News show - Dr. Zavalosa

Note: I don't think anyone here wants to watch Fox News longer than it takes to pick up the remote, Zavalosa. - Veritas

Note: I want to test my results again. If I have managed to find a method to control 914’s output, it would be important to ensure that results are repeatable in accordance with the scientific method. - Dr. Zavalosa

Input: One battery-operated radio box with two AA batteries inserted, the radio is on, currently playing the same evening talk show as before
Setting: Fine
Output: A set of miniature animate Teletubbies made from plastic and copper. Upon opening the Output booth, the teletubbies marched out and circled Dr. Zavalosa, singing the Teletubbies theme song, before sitting down and becoming inanimate.

Note: What on earth? - Dr. Zavalosa

You're new, I presume? Don't worry, you'll get used to it. - Junior Researcher Kai

Test 914-0972
Name: Dr. Leon.
Date: 27/08/2019
Total items: A 2020-2021 calendar and five pencils

Input: All items described above
Setting: Fine
Output: The same calendar with what seem like dates, events and general notes in an unknown language and/or script, wood snippets from laser cut pencils.

Note: I am scared to find out what it reads, because the events from the previous test were correct. Should we really translate this? -Dr. Leon

Note: Confirmed. The more we know, the better we can prepare for it. - Hackett

Test 914-0973
Name: Dr. Zavalosa, D-7246
Date: 27/08/2019
Total Items: One prototype SCRAMBLE visor

Note: I’m quite happy to have obtained this piece of tech. SCRAMBLE visors were initially made to contain SCP-096, but modern versions have advanced to also protect its user against cognitohazards and memetic dangers. Truly a marvel of engineering - Dr. Zavalosa

Input: Above
Setting: Fine
Output: A visually unchanged visor. When equipped, user reports to see nothing through it ‘like being blindfolded’

Note: I’m familiar with how dangerous SCP-914 can be, so I requested a Class-D to retrieve and test the visor. Still, this is highly disappointing, the only improvement the visor has is to be able to sleep easier while wearing it. - Dr. Zavalosa

Note: The Memetics department have reported that the visor does have an effect. The visors will stream cognitohazards in the field of view of user, and only cognitohazards, this also includes hazards behind walls or in containment to a range of ███ meters. D-7246 was terminated after being afflicted with [DATA EXPUNGED]. I wonder if the visor's effect extends to SCP-096’s face, but I don’t think I want to be proven right - Dr. Zavalosa

Test 914-0974
Name: Researcher Laskenta; D-40049; D-94004
Date: 27/08/2019
Total Items: One pair of glasses, without correction; One printed article about ███, a company that creates ''smart glasses''.

Note: An acquaintance of mine showed me a German Austrian news report about them and their plan to replace smartphones within five years. This is a very high set bar; I am sure 914 has something to contribute to this. -Laskenta

Input: Mentioned items
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The same items. The glasses were not found inside the output booth, but rather on top of the selection panel. Testing showed that putting on the glasses will result in a cognitohazardous effect, affecting every humanoid life form that is perceived by the subject through the glasses. Affected life forms will feel the need to mention "what wonderful glasses they are" and that they "are going to change everything". Pointing out the position of the glasses, will make them teleport on top of the person, who stated the position. The new wearer will be oblivious to the new position and the effect, and the glasses will anomalously stay on top of the subject until removed by somebody else. The article was found to be unchanged and non-anomalous. Both items have been incinerated. Items held no anomalous feature afterwards.

Note: It was as amusing as it was tiring to watch D-40049 and D-94004 repeat themselves over and over again, both stating that they can see the goggles on top of the other one. -Laskenta

Addendum: In a conversation between Researcher Laskenta and Junior Researcher Drant, Researcher Laskenta stated: "Yes, [the glasses] have been [incinerated]. In the incinerator.", upon which the glasses reappeared on top of Researcher Laskenta. The glasses seem to be able to reform and repair themselves as long as the near exact position of destruction is mentioned while referring to the output. Junior Researcher Drant has destroyed the test result again at an unknown location and applied Class A amnestics to himself.

Test 914-0975
Name: Researcher Tsumiki Miniwa
Date: 27/08/2019
Total Items: One figurine each of "Guido Mista", "Noriaki Kakyoin", "Hierophant Green", "The World" and six figurines of "███ Pistols", numbered one through seven, skipping four. All figurines are from the anime/manga series "JoJo's Bizarre Adventures”.

Input: One figurine of The World
Setting: Fine
Output: One figurine of Star Platinum

Input: One figurine of Guido Mista, six figurines of ███ Pistols
Setting: Fine
Output: One animated figurine of Guido Mista. Before attempting to capture it, security personnel were warned of the abilities of the ███ Pistols. Each of the six figurines can ride bullets and can subsequently kick the bullet to control its motion, giving the appearance of the bullets changing direction midair and “bouncing off thin air". Animated figurine was captured by precisely a team of five security personnel before being incinerated.

I picked exactly five security personnel for capturing the figurine because I know that Mista in JoJo is afraid of the number four. Makes it easier on security in case it decided to overreact. - Miniwa

Input: One figurine of Noriaki Kakyoin, one figurine of Hierophant Green
Setting: Fine
Output: One animated figurine of Noriaki Kakyoin and a painting of Researcher Miniwa. The figurine struck the painting on the knee, which immediately gave Researcher Miniwa a scratch on the knee. Both objects incinerated after a hole was put through the figurine's chest by Researcher Miniwa's request.

Note: And 914 is even aware of the one-off abilities. - Miniwa

Test 914-0976
Name: WR Grizelle Markham, D-39003
Date: 27/08/2019
Total Items: Three episodes (1, 5, 12) of the anime Coyote Ragtime Show, each placed in a Kingston 4 GB USB drive with FSTS partition, three pieces of A3 sized paper, three pencils.

Input: Episode 1 of the anime Coyote Ragtime Show, one A3 sized paper, one pencil.
Setting: Fine
Output: A miniature replica of a Luger pistol, and a sketch of the characters January, April, May, and September (the four first generation Marciano's Sisters). Neither item is anomalous.

Input: Episode 5 of the anime Coyote Ragtime Show, one A3 sized paper, one pencil.
Setting: Fine
Output: Two items:

A 1:100 model of the titular Coyotes (in-series name for space bandits). This item is not anomalous.
A picture, which whenever shown to people with a cognitohazardous resistance rating below 36, shows a black-and-white bird's eye view of Memphis, TN, with Graceland Mansion highlighted. When shown to people with a cognitohazardous resistance rating above 36, a sketch depicting three women embracing each other is seen instead.
Note: Said episode's plot revolves around the Coyotes trying to leave the space station to get to their destination, Graceland. Looks like 914 took "Graceland" a little too literally. But the sketch is wonderful. - Markham.

Input: Episode 12 of the anime Coyote Ragtime Show, one A3 sized paper, one pencil.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Two items:

A sketch of the Coyotes on a vacation in [REDACTED], interrupted by five of Marciano's 12 Sisters. The sketch animates every hour, with different outcomes thus far, ranging from further interruption from law enforcement, to the adult Coyote members being killed as revenge for September's death. One outcome depicted SCP-2578 conducting an Impaler Event on Mister and April (leaders of the Coyotes and the Sisters respectively).
A 1:50 model of Madame Marciano, which proceeded to attack D-39003 with a miniature FN P90. The bullets anomalously penetrated through the legs of D-39003, crippling him. Object was promptly neutralized through the usage of the H2O-9000.
Test 914-0977
Name: Junior Researcher McLaif, D-39654
Date: 27/08/2019
Total Items: One chess set and board.

Note: It has been demonstrated before that 914 is capable of playing chess and solving puzzles. It has also been observed that 914's "1:1" setting will turn certain games/puzzles to a different one, such as different shapes of rotating puzzles. I have brought D-39654 because of their extensive experience with various tabletop games and puzzles. D-39654 is designated as White, and 914 as Black. — McLaif

Input: Aforementioned chess board, pieces at starting positions. White pawn moved to e4.
Setting: 1:1
Output: Same chess board, with Black knight to c6.

Input: Above output, with White knight to g3.
Setting: 1:1
Output: Same chess board, Black checker to d5.

Input: Above output, with White checker to c3.
Setting: 1:1
Output: Same chess board, Black checker to g6.

Tests 4-11 removed for brevity.

Input: Above output, with White pawn to a8 and promoting to a queen.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A black-and-white Monopoly board, with the White queen and Black queen as the board pieces. Captured pawns and checkers from tests 1-11 have been transformed into a full Monopoly set made out of plastic, sans player pieces. Black queen is on Mediterranean Avenue, and Black owns the property.

Tests 13-17 removed for brevity.

Input: Above output. White queen moved to unowned Illinois Avenue after a roll of 19. Illinois Avenue bought for $240.
Setting: 1:1
Output: Same Monopoly board. Black queen moved to White-owned Boardwalk. Black pays $600 in rent.

Input: Above output. White pawn moved to Mediterranean Avenue after a roll of 3. $250 in rent paid to Black.
Setting: 1:1
Output: The output chamber was empty, except for player-owned properties, houses, pieces, and money. Everything else was transformed into a 52-card deck of cards made of black and white plastic. The setup in the chamber closely resembles a game of Blackjack. White begins play, with Junior Researcher McLaif acting as the dealer.

Tests 20-39 removed for brevity.

Input: Above output. White bets their bishop and Marvin Gardens. Dealt a Ten of Clubs for a hand of 18. White verbally chooses to stand.
Setting: 1:1
Output: Above input, with Black's hand revealed as a white 9, a black reverse, and Mediterranean Avenue. White gains Black's three checkers, $10, and a house.

Input: Above output, with the play area cleared and prepared for a round of Blackjack. White and Black are both dealt two cards each. White bets $5, a hotel, and a black checker.
Setting: 1:1
Output: An empty play area, except for two 30-card plastic decks, one black and one white, Monopoly currency and deed cards, and chess pieces. Upon inspection by Junior Researcher McLaif, these decks were valid Magic the Gathering decks, one specializing in black cards, the other white. In addition, the Monopoly currency now has text saying "1 HP" instead of the usual design. The black deck was given to White, and the white deck given to Black, with White stating their preference to black decks. Both decks were shuffled, and White started play by playing a Swamp, and Junior Researcher McLaif acting as referee.

Tests 42-53 removed for brevity.

Input: The current board state. White currently has 10 HP and $30 left, and Black 20 HP and $195.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A chess board appears, with the Magic cards in play shrunk to the size of checker pieces, and placed in the same positions as the chess and checker pieces were before test #12.

Input: The above output. White plays Magic as normal, then moves his cards as chess pieces.
Setting: 1:1
Output: The above input, with Black having played and moved its cards.

Tests 56-67 removed for brevity.

Input: Above output, with White tapping the b5 Swamp and playing a Dread Wanderer on f6, along with a verbal request to trade a Deadeye Tracker for Park Place. White Death Cultist attacks Black face, dealing 1 damage. Black's balance is now 3 HP, with White having 12 HP.
Setting: 1:1
Output: Above input, with the Black king on its side in surrender.

Note: Not sure what to conclude from this, other than 914 having exceptional tabletop gaming skill. -McLaif

Test 914-0978
Name: Senior Researcher Vivic
Date: 01/09/2019
Total Items: Six One electromagnet with a strength of 1.25T
Input: One electromagnet
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One unchanged magnet When supplied with power, the electromagnet was found to have gained additional magnetic strength anomalously and flew off the testing room floor. It appeared to be drawn only to metals used in biomechanical applications, which caused it to collide with Senior Researcher Vivic's prosthetic left arm at roughly 15m/s, causing moderate damage. The electromagnet then fell to the floor and cracked in half 5 seconds after impact, losing all anomalous and non-anomalous properties. Output incinerated.

Note: That was extremely painful. No more magnets and all my other tests have been cancelled. I don't know how it went after the metal in my arm and not 914 itself, so I'll be in the medical bay. - Senior Researcher Vivic

Note: So a researcher with a prosthetic arm was refining an electromagnet? I'm wondering when we can expect prosthetic frontal lobes, to allow researchers like this to have better decision making in the future. - Veritas

Name: Researcher Vil
Date: 01/09/2019
Total Items: One Samsung Galaxy brand smartphone, One iPhone X smartphone

Input: The aforementioned item
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Same output. Testing shows that the device's Operating System is upgraded to Android ██, though no update of the Android OS has been released at this time.

Note: Android Popsicle Cake version. Some kind of taste. - Vil

Input: Previous Output
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A holographic device which only turns on when Dr. Veritas laughs.

Note: Going to try a 1:1 setting to see if it can be activated without laughing. - Vil

Input: Previous Output
Setting: 1:1
Output: A holographic device which only turns on when Dr. Veritas smiles

Note: Gift for you Dr. Veritas, hope you like it. - Vil

Note: Don't know if it's commentary of my general mood or not on 914's part. If it is, you try keeping these idiots in line for as long as I have. - Veritas

Input: iPhone X Smartphone
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A smartphone of unknown make and brand, when turned on a Prometheus Labs OS logo is displayed. Device has a password lock.

Note: Is there a person here that can hack devices? Maybe we'll get more information once we crack this phone.

Test 914-0980
Name: Researcher Miniwa
Date: 01/09/2019
Total Items: 6-core 3.8GHz processor, Nvidia 2060 graphics card. Spare metal.

Input: 6-core 3.8GHz processor, Nvidia RTX 2060 graphics card. Spare metal.
The processor and graphics card was a significant chunk of my weekly research budget. I swear, this is for research, though. Spare metal applied "to help 914", as it does not break conservation of energy (?) - Miniwa
Setting: Fine
Output: 8-core 16-thread 5GHz calculation speed processor, Nvidia 2080 Ti graphics card.
Really high-end. Would stop here and keep it, but then Veritas would yell at me for "using SCP research money for my own purposes", which is fair. - Miniwa

Input: Previous Output, and more spare metal.
Setting: Fine
Output: Processor and Graphics card have been fused into one "supercomputer"
A few tests on this… 10GHz calculation speed, and I didn't have any way to test the graphics card, besides playing some FPS games at max quality for a couple of minutes. - Miniwa

Input: Previous output, and more spare metal.
Setting: Very Fine
Running very fine on this one, for the sake of Very Fine. My first Very Fine test! - Miniwa
Output: Robot, with similar traits to that of the character Izuna Hatsuse from the series "No Game No Life".

After a little panic that it would destroy the entire sector, It turns out that it just wants to play some games. - Miniwa

Note: Repeated testing on over ███ D-class in over 20 different games and over four different genres shows that playing against the robot induces anger 100% of the time, to a level of physical violence between the players. Testing the robot against AI causes the computer to turn itself off seconds before the AI is defeated. - Miniwa

Note: If we ever need to occupy the robot for long periods of time, it seems we can just put it up against an "unbeatable" game. I convinced it to play a 1v3 against cheating-difficulty bots in Supreme Commander 2 and it's spent the past three days doing rematches. - Intern Snevets

Test 914-0981
Name: Intern Snevets
Date: 03/09/2019
Total Items: One set of Apple-brand “EarPods”

After last time, I’ve decided to go with something safer. I’ve always thought that these could use a bit higher audio quality - Intern Snevets

Input: EarPods
Setting: Fine
Output: Same set of EarPods, no longer functional.

Note: Whoever’s playing that music, turn it down. - Dr. Veritas

Note: The EarPods do function, but it would appear that sounds played by them are produced from a point inside the ears of Dr. Veritas, rather than the speakers.

Note: I’ve incinerated them myself. Not taking the chance that someone pulls them out of the bin. - Intern Snevets

Test 914-0982
Name: Junior Researcher McLaif
Date: 02/09/2019
Total Items: 1 bandaged 6x6 ██████-brand puzzle cube, 1 unsolvable 4x4 ██████-brand puzzle cube, taken from the break room

Note: I was getting frustrated of looking at a fully solved set of puzzles except for two in the break room. This is also an excuse to further test re-refining with 914. —McLaif

Input: The 4x4 cube.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A highly intricate model of 914 made out of plastic in a similar style to a gear cube. Found to be nonanomalous and functions as a gear cube-like puzzle. Rotating the input and output booths twists the gears in unpredictable ways. Solved by Junior Researcher McLaif in █ hours.

I should note that there is a very high chance of being pinched by the 914-cube if you put your fingers in the wrong place, which I found out the hard way. —McLaif

Input: The 6x6 cube.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A shuffled 6x6 rotating tesseract puzzle. X-ray analysis shows a complex internal mechanism connecting the outer faces to seven more 6x6 cubes inside. Turning the outer face leads to a completely unrelated move for each of the inner cubes. Upon solving one cube of the tesseract, the cube turns inside out with a different cube replacing the outer one. Solved after █ days by Junior Researcher McLaif.

I have placed all the outputs in the break room. Though, have fun trying to solve the 6x6 without also getting your fingers pinched by the cubes turning inside out. —McLaif

Test 914-0983
Name: Researcher Vil
Date: 04/09/2019
Total Items: A small chalkboard, a box of chalk and a note written "What can we learn from you?"

Note: I think 914 can show us something educational. -Vil

Input: The aforementioned items.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A set of rules on "How to use SCP-914 without getting harmed" written on the chalkboard, the note changed and is now written "Sometimes you just have to make your thoughts a little less wild."

Test 914-0984
Name: Intern Walker
Date: 09/09/2019
Total Items: One bag of ████████ brand tortilla chips which cannot be opened, one flash drive containing a copy of a document titled "914 Brand Hops", one flash drive containing a copy of pseudocode for replacing all liquids in ten meters with coffee, one metronome that makes people within 3 meters walk in time to the beat

Note: Anomalous storage is full of all sorts of neat, unused things. It's time to use some of them. I've chosen a useless item, a dangerous item, and two replicable items for this session. - Intern Walker

Input: One unopenable bag of ████████ brand tortilla chips
Setting: Coarse
Output: One empty unopenable bag of ████████ brand tortilla chips, a pile of chips.

Note: It turns out that the bag, although impossible to open, could still have the chips removed. - Intern Walker

Input: The two flash drives
Setting: 1:1
Output: One flash drive, containing code for replacing all liquids in the range of 9.144 meters with 914 Brand Hops. When plugged into a computer by a D-class, he immediately showed signs of intoxication. D-█████ lost out after two minutes. Computer disabled remotely, subject expired.

Input: One metronome that makes people walk to the beat
Setting: Fine
Output: One metronome, which attunes itself to any vibrations within 3 meters that reach it. It appears to set itself to average frequency felt over the last 30 seconds.
Note: Even breathing in its direction sets this thing off now. The vents. People walking in the parking lot. The microwave in the break room. This thing can't turn off. Click click click click click click… It's driving me nuts. - Intern Walker

Addendum: About an hour after testing ended, Dr. Veritas became very agitated and went to take it to be incinerated. As he approached it, the metronome suddenly clocked over ███ kilohertz before breaking. Object was incinerated.

Note: I can't prove this, but I could swear the metronome must've broken underneath the stress, as Dr. Veritas was fuming by the time he arrived to take the thing away. I'm both really impressed and absolutely terrified. - Intern Walker

Test 914-0985
Name: Intern Walker
Date: 05/09/2019
Total Items: Box of assorted ███████-brand city-building models.

Note: Seven hundred dollars of Japanese imports. I'm going to be eating ramen this month. - Intern Walker

Input: Four city blocks of light industrial buildings
Setting: 1:1
Output: Four city blocks of light commercial buildings

Input: Above output
Setting: Fine
Output: Two city blocks of heavy commercial buildings. The plastic from half the input was used to improve the other half.

Input: Ten city blocks of airport, three model planes
Setting: Fine
Output: Seven city blocks of forest, two city blocks of spaceport terminal, one city block of launch pads, three model rocket planes.

Note: ███████ does not make forest models, spaceports, or rocket planes. - Intern Walker

Input: Tokyo Tower
Setting: Fine
Output: Eiffel Tower. When placed in low light, tiny plastic bulbs start emitting colored light. Upon further testing, the light bulbs seem to contain a nitrogenous analogue to phosphor.

I'm going to build a city with all these pieces. Guards are are on standby, equipped with bug nets and acid spray, should things get out of hand. - Intern Walker

Input: A model city, containing all above outputs
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A futuristic model of [REDACTED], containing Site-19. It is well lit, and all the vehicles are animate. Additionally, there are flying cars floating around the city. The rocket planes broke containment and attempted to escape the building, but were recontained by security guards with the bug nets.

Note: Unless someone can come up with a display case before something breaks containment again, as entertaining as this city is to watch, it will be sent back through on Rough. - Intern Walker

Note: I have some plastic display boxes laying around somewhere, I think. If you want them feel free to stop by. -Intern Lunar

Addendum: After being left overnight in Lunar's plastic display box, the security team discovered that the display box had been destroyed. New tiles that resembled construction sites had appeared on the outskirts of the city. Security footage shows that model drills rolled to the wall and started boring through the plastic. Cranes loaded the plastic shrapnel onto cargo trucks, which then hauled it to the industrial sector. Then, cement trucks brought the now molten plastic back to the edge of the city, to pour it like concrete. The city set and the display box were taken back to 914.

Input: Above output, minus three industrial, three commercial, and nine residential tiles, as well as the city hall.
Setting: Rough
Output: A large pile of powdered plastic

Note: Admittedly, this thing has grown on me, and I can't in good conscience kill them all. I have a glass box big enough for this. Surely they can't break out of glass, right? I made sure that the buildings in this part of the city were "populated" before shredding the rest. The box will remain in with my belongings until I can get an office. - Intern Walker

Note: At your own risk, as per usual. Get clearance from Sedna first. - Veritas

Test 914-0986
Name: Senior Researcher Vivic
Date: 06/09/2019
Total Items: Six 3D printed plastic objects, one 3L bag of 2% Milk (fresh), four heavily used spark plugs, two cans of Pringle's chips, one artificial skeleton on a metal stand

Input: 3D printed model of a modern army Jeep; 10cm tall.
Setting: Fine
Output: A 3D printed model of T45 power armour, similar to that from the Fallout 4 video game. The limbs of the model can be moved much like an action figure.

Note: I'm keeping this on my desk after I paint it. - Vivic

Input: A 3D printed model of Iron Man; 8cm tall.
Setting: 1:1
Output: The plastic rearranged into the words " I love you 3000 " on a flat plastic base.

Note: I swear this thing is sentient and watches movies when we aren't around. - Vivic

Note: It doesn't have eyes, Vivic. - Veritas

Input: A 3D printed model of ''5 dimensional cube'' in a wireframe design
Setting: Fine
Output: A 3D printed model of a ''6 dimensional object'' that causes headaches when viewed and impossible to describe. Fell apart after 30 seconds. No anomalous properties remain.

Input: A 3D printed model of a Charizard of the Pokémon franchise; 10cm
Setting: Fine
Output: The same model; however, it is far more detailed than theoretically possible with current technology. Zooming in with high powered microscopes reveals visible pores and scales.

Input: A 3D printed model of a DeLorean car with sideways hover style wheels, 8cm in length.
Setting: Very fine
Output: Upon opening of the output door, the result launched out of the output booth at speeds up to 39.2m/s and crashed into the reinforced wall.

Input: A 3D printed model of a Stirling Engine, 12cm tall and non functional.
Setting: Fine
Output: A plastic model of PlayStation 4 with clear damage from over heating.

Input: 4 used spark plugs
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A square of metal with bulbous ceramic growths on each corner and bolt like shapes upon each 90° angle of the ceramic corner balls. Within the metal square seems to be a constant influx of positive ions causing a painful static shock upon touching the prey metal. However a greater current can be built up by swinging the object through the air. Testing shows a maximum power of 15Amps.

Input: One can of Pringle's chips.
Setting: Coarse.
Output: A stack of chips and the cardboard container separated. The cardboard looks like it was peeled away from the chips.

Input: Human model skeleton with metal stand (100cm).
Setting: 1:1
Output: A what can be assumed accurate skeletal model of SCP-682 human sized and standing on its hind legs.

Note: That is kinda terrifying to look at, I'm certain it's harmless and I'm done with my tests for today, luckily I didn't get injured again. - Researcher Vivic

Test 914-0987
Name: Dr. Murdo (Foundation Virology Labs)
Date: 10/09/2019
Total Items: 1 sealed vial of Experimental Beneficial Strain Q-235

Note: This test was illicitly performed under the guise of refining acceptable non-biological items for testing.

Input: 1 sealed vial
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One sealed vial, visually unchanged. Disposed of via SCP-123.

FURTHER TESTS ABORTED BY ON-SITE SECURITY

Note: Why?! I could have made the perfect beneficial strain! - Dr. Murdo

Note: No, I don't [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] care how "beneficial" it supposedly is, the rules are perfectly clear. For all we know that refined vial could have held a super-strain of influenza. - Veritas

Note: Dr. Murdo has been amnesticized and discharged from Foundation employment by order of Dr. Hackett and Dr. Veritas

Test 914-0988
Name: Junior Researcher McLaif, D-80243
Date: 10/09/2019
Total Items: Five variety packs of ███████-brand lollipops.

Note: This test will serve to see what happens to food when refined by 914, mainly taste. - McLaif

Input: One pack.
Setting: Rough
Output: An amorphous mass of caramelized sugar, melted polyethylene, and charred paper. D-80243 reported a "very burnt caramel" flavor.

Input: One pack.
Setting: Coarse
Output: A pile of paper sticks, a pile of clear lollipop heads, and the original pack bag containing some coloring and unidentified chemicals. D-80243 reported the lollipop heads to taste identically to common table sugar. After analyzing the liquid in the bag, it was found that it was a mix of food coloring and artificial flavoring. D-80243 reports this mixture as "what those banana candies taste like."

Input: One pack.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A ██████-brand variety pack of various flavors of taffy, with paper packaging and flavor guide. Each flavor of taffy corresponds to a flavor in the original lollipop bag. D-80243 reports the taffy as "pretty much the same as the lollipops, but chewy."

Input: One pack.
Setting: Fine
Output: A spherical jawbreaker 8 cm in diameter in paper and plastic packaging, labeled in an unknown language. Output is similar to snack foods as dispensed by SCP-261. D-80243 reported, "It's very… fruity. There's some sort of salty flavor in there, too. Oh, I'm tasting something meaty now. It doesn't taste like anything I've eaten before, though. Very fatty-tasting."

Input: One pack.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: [DATA EXPUNGED]. D-80423 was admitted to the medical ward with severe chemical burns to his tongue, and released after 12 days. Further analysis shows that the output contained citric acid at an anomalously high concentration.

Addendum: After D-80243's tongue recovered, the test with the Fine output continued. Additional flavors included mustard, cheese cake, monosodium glutamate, vinegar, table salt, denatonium benzoate, pure capsaicin, DNA, jawbreakers, copper, cardboard, and "fruit".

Test 914-0989
Name: Researcher Ija Rasclon.
Date: 10/09/2019
Total Items: 3 copies of the blueprints for the 'Mechanical Turk' hoax chess-playing robot.

Note: Yes, I'm back. The higher-ups recommended me for study on "a high-risk item" due to my high adherence to safety guidelines and cognitohazard resistance value. I figured, if I had to be in the same country as that god-forsaken capacitor, I might as well be somewhere I can monitor it. That, and the next option was 682. Anyway, we've seen that 914 can 'comprehend' games, and can understand writing. I want to see what it will make of a game-playing machine, albeit a fake one. -R. Rasclon

Input: 1 blueprint.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A labelled anatomic blueprint of a "Turkish Mechanic". Blueprints were consistent with regular human anatomy, with the somewhat notable exception of an absent appendix.

Input: 1 blueprint.
Setting: Fine
Output: Simplified flowchart depicting the functioning and construction of IBM's 'Deep Blue' chess-playing computer.

Input: 1 blueprint.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A 1mm thick piece of A5 sized paper, shaped into a rectangular prism, with the same total mass as the original blueprint. Ink was not present on the surface of the paper. Upon being touched with a piece for a physical game, or the beginning state of a pen-and-paper game with fixed rules and moves being drawn upon the paper, the paper will initiate a game with the person who touched/drew upon it. The paper will not initiate a match of any game involving randomness which does not arise directly from player decision. The paper seems anomalously capable of detecting the board state of the game it is playing, and seems to be a perfect player. Following are the conducted tests.

Game: Sprouts, two-dot permutation.
Player: First
Result: Ink appeared on the surface, spelling the word "concede".

Game: Sprouts, two-dot permutation.
Player: Second
Result: Victory for second player.

[Further Sprouts tests removed for brevity: similar results. Instant concession when given unwinnable position, victory when given winning position.]

Game: Connect Four, columns labeled 1-7.
Player: Second, first player played in column 4.
Result: Concession.

Game: Connect Four, columns labeled 1-7.
Player: Second, first player played in column 7.
Result: Paper communicated its moves by causing a number from 1-7 to appear on itself in ink. Victory for second player.

Game: Connect Four.
Player: First
Result: Victory for first player.

Game: Chess.
Player: White
Result: Concession.

Note: The tech guys willll have a field day with that one. -R. Rasclon

Game: Tic-tac-toe.
Player: Crosses
Result: Ink pooled around the base of the paper. Further testing determined the item was neutralized.

Note: Shame. Might've studied that for use with SCP-1384. Still, I'll take a benign VF result over a dangerous one any day. -R. Rasclon

Test 914-0990
Name: Junior Researcher Steven
Date: 10/09/2019
Total Items: Four 500 piece jigsaw puzzles

Input: One jigsaw puzzle
Setting: Coarse
Output: One jigsaw, with all the tabs ripped off the pieces and placed in a pile

Input: One jigsaw puzzle
Setting: 1:1
Output: The same jigsaw pieces, with a different picture

Input: One jigsaw puzzle
Setting: Fine
Output: 250 blank jigsaw pieces and 250 double sided pieces

Input: One jigsaw puzzle
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 500 identical non-anomalous jigsaw pieces. When assembled the final piece becomes a cognitohazard, making it invisible to all direct viewers

Note: After looking for a jigsaw piece for an hour, I'm not sure why I wanted to be assigned here again - J.R. Steven

Test 914-0991
Name: Dr. Haywood
Date: 10/09/2019
Total Items: ~65 m3 of Earth atmosphere

Note: Hey all, I've just been assigned here. For my first test, I'm trying something that, surprisingly, no one has thought of before. What happens if we try to refine the air inside the intake booth? It still has mass, just not a lot of it. I'll be taking the following safety precautions:

Everyone in the testing chamber will be wearing a gas mask hooked up to an air tank.
The input booth will be sterilized prior to each test.
An atmospheric sensor/alarm package has been placed next to the output door, set to activate the emergency seals in the chamber's ventilation system if any harmful gases are detected. Any compound marked as overtly poisonous in the database will trip it.
Input: ~13 m3 of Earth atmosphere
Setting: 1:1
Output: ~13 m3 of Earth atmosphere, heated to 30°C. Dissipated harmlessly into site climate control system; noted to have a faint "tropical" scent.

Input: ~13 m3 of Earth atmosphere
Setting: Coarse
Output: All gases present in the input were frozen into solid cubes. When the output booth door was opened, a pressure wave rushed to fill the vacuum in the output booth, causing a small explosion. No damage to SCP-914. Frozen gases dissipated harmlessly.

Note: Nearly popped my damn eardrums though, not to mention giving the guard a heart attack. Also, where'd the atmosphere in the output booth go? Did it get swapped with the input?

Note: Skipping Rough setting, seeing as we'd probably get a similar output.

Input: ~13 m3 of Earth atmosphere
Setting: Fine
Output: ~13 m3 of unchanged Earth atmosphere a (presumably) over-oxygenated mix of Earth atmosphere. Further investigation revealed an extremely thin layer of crushed graphite on the floor of the output booth, indicating that the refining process had stripped the carbon from the CO2 present in the input.

Note: It's an improvement, yes, but a suspiciously direct one. I really hope that gas mix doesn't have any anomalous properties, since it's already in the ventilation at this point.

Note: Your suspicions have been confirmed. My office is the closest to the central unit, and I started feeling lightheaded right after you ran this test. Looks like 914 joined the nitrogen and oxygen into nitrous oxide - laughing gas - which isn't flagged as poisonous in the database. I'd recommend adding pharmaceutical and medicinal compounds to the trip list. Remind me to sign you up for a mandatory hazardous material seminar. - Veritas

Note: I found Jeff (the mug cat, in case you haven't met him) face-first in a vent acting stoned, and personally I have a massive headache. Good job. - Intern Lunar

Note: As per request of many confused and dizzy patients, all medicinal substances, whether they can be turned into a gaseous state or not, have been added to the list of automatically filtered compounds in the site's ventilation database. -Doctor Starr

Input: ~13 m3 of Earth atmosphere
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A 2.5 kg block of the military-grade explosive RDX (C3H6N6O6). Test detonations of material samples reveal that the explosion is anomalously endothermic. Remaining material sent to anomalous item storage.

Note: For anyone not familiar with chemistry terms, endothermic means it takes in heat rather than outputting it, which is exothermic. Simply put, it's a cold explosive. I did run some additional tests on samples, and it appears that the chemical structure is identical to that of non-anomalous RDX, so unfortunately the effect isn't replicable.

Test 914-0992
Name: WR Grizelle Markham
Date: 10/09/2019
Total Items: Two LAR Grizzly Winchester Magnum pistols, one photo of WR Markham and the Grizzly entity (in the form of a selfie), one map of Iraqi Kurdistan

Note: Grizzly reminds me of my sister Marianne, who died in a car accident five years ago. To put this, she's basically my sister if she wore purple contact lenses, and if she was more eccentric… - WR Markham

Input: One LAR Grizzly Win Mag pistol
Setting: Coarse
Output: [REDACTED] Kel-Tec PMR-30 automatic pistols, showing signs of rusting and scorching. Pistols are still functional despite damage.

Note: The only thing that I can say is that number is not an integer, and yes, that part-pistol is also functional. ████ me. - WR Markham

Input: One LAR Grizzly Win Mag pistol, one map of Iraqi Kurdistan
Setting: Fine
Output: One Beretta 92SB-F pistol with a suppressor installed, covered in purple paint. No personnel on site are able to use the pistol. Further testing discovered that said pistol may only be wielded by Kurds in Iraq.

Note: Not that out of the ordinary I guess. - WR Markham

Input: Photo
Setting: Fine
Output: A photo of Karlsruhe on 05/07/2014, showing WR Markham's older sister leaving Pfarrkirche St. Stephan. This photo causes people to remember the latest instance where a family member died with maximal detail.

Note: That's where she got hit… WR Markham

Addendum: WR Markham was later found in the personnel residence drinking glasses of sake and playing Billie Eilish songs at maximum volume assigned to mandatory psychiatric evaluation by order of Dr. Veritas. Radio destroyed.

Test 914-0993
Name: Doctor Starr and Assistant Researcher Smith
Date: 01/06/2019 (Last Edited on 10/09/2019)
Total Items: 5 Hanhart 1/5 Second Mechanical Stopwatches

Note: It's been a week since my previous test with “9BPK” and I’m still haunted by the output. I’ve decided to halt my testing on medical supplies temporarily and try a more mundane object. I’m curious to see how 914 reacts to more harmless mechanical devices. -Doctor Starr

Input: One stopwatch
Setting: Rough

Note: Loud, thumping noises resonated from within 914 during the refinement process. -Doctor Starr

Output: Output ejected out of output booth where it hit the opposite wall at 20 km/hour, fragmenting across the room. Footage reveals the object was a heavily dented stopwatch with a broken second hand.

Note: It is safe to assume the dents were caused by a hammer-like object, which explains the loud noises heard before. Cause of such violent behavior from 914 is unknown. Proceeding with increased caution. -Doctor Starr

Input: One Stopwatch
Setting: Coarse
Output: A pure ingot of silver weighing about 0.5 kg, a deconstructed battery, and a pile of glass shards. The second hand is the only component missing from the input. Upon closer inspection, there is a sequence that resembles the ternary code for the word G-E-A-R-S on the top of the ingot.

Input: One Stopwatch
Setting: 1:1
Output: Two 1/10 second mechanical stopwatches each half the mass as the original input. The objects are branded with the name ''Pestori'', but no manufacturer exists under this name at the time of writing. Items spontaneously fell apart upon leaving the testing chamber. Upon returning the object components back to the chamber, stopwatches were anonymously self reassembled. Reassembling the watch permanently outside of the testing chamber is impossible.

Input: One Stopwatch
Setting: Fine
Output: A mechanical hand watch that can tell the exact hour and day of the week. It is set over three months ahead and has no way of being adjusted. Both the input second hand and the missing hand from the previous test have been turned into the day hand and hour hand on the watch. Similarly, object fell apart upon leaving the testing chamber but did not reassemble upon re-entering. No anomalous effects detected outside of testing chamber. Output incinerated.

Input: One Stopwatch
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An engraved stopwatch of the same brand, Pestori, as the 1:1 output. Across the entire object are ornate patterns and floral designs. On the back are the words, “Property of Doctor Starr. Please return if lost.” D-Class was unable to push down the crown of the stopwatch or find any other way to interact with it. After 10 minutes of failure to start the watch, D-64892 is ordered to hand over the output to security personnel and be escorted to their cell. Upon receiving the output, Doctor Starr clicks the crown on the watch, whereupon it started counting. Upon Doctor Starr stopping the timer just after the ten second mark, he disappeared. There are no indications of where he disappeared to nor are there any signs of space alteration.

Incident reported to administration and a “Death of Personnel” notice was filed for Doctor Starr after a week of his disappearance.

Note: The previous and the following information has been edited as of 10/09/2019.

Today, at 2:36 AM, Doctor Starr reappeared holding the fragmented remains of the output of the previous test. Almost shot by a security guard who was stationed a meter away from him. All components of output incinerated.

Note: I was gone for 101 days. I was thrown through time after the watch was activated for ten or so seconds, which in ternary is 101. To be entirely honest, that was very clever. -Doctor Starr

Test 914-0994
Name: Senior Researcher Vivic
Date: 10/09/2019
Total Items: Twenty three 1kg ingots of aircraft-grade aluminum, fifteen 1m2 strips of white linen

Input: 2kg of aluminium, 1m2 of linen.
Setting: Fine
Output: A three dimensional sculpture of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci made of aluminium, with the linen as her dress.

Note: Wow… just, wow. I didn't know 914 had such a fine taste in art. No pun intended. - Vivic

Input: 2kg of aluminum, 1m2 of linen.
Setting: 1:1
Output: An aluminum picture frame measuring 31.14cm2, with the linen folded several times and stretched over it. The SCP Foundation logo has been embroidered onto the linen with aluminum wool.

Input: 1kg of aluminum, 1m2 of linen.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A small model of a bridge designed by Leonardo da Vinci with the linen wrapped around the conjunction points. The model can be disassembled into 17 small aluminum rods and 13 linen strips.

Input: 1kg of aluminum, 1m2 of linen.
Setting: Fine
Output: A functional anemometer of the same design as the one produced by Leonardo
da Vinci in 1486.

Input: 1kg of aluminum, 2m2 of linen.
Setting: Fine
Output: A scaled down, yet functional replica of a parachute designed by Leonardo da Vinci.

Note: I guess 914's a fan of da Vinci's work? Has anyone used handcrafted linen in 914 before? Am I being affected by a memetic hazard? - Vivic

Input: 1kg of aluminum.
Setting: Fine
Output: A highly detailed bust of the current Queen of England. Later determined to have the exact facial expression on the Queen at the moment of testing.

Input: 2kg of aluminum.
Setting: Fine
Output: A detailed model of a Foundation Site numbered 05, which is confirmed to not exist. Output incinerated.

Note: Senior Researcher Vivic has been administered Class-A amnestics on his request.

Input: 4kg of aluminum, 4m2 of linen.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A functional model of Leonardo da Vinci's aerial screw helicopter. After the output booth was opened, the model proceeded to fly out and hover above Senior Researcher Vivic's head. The screw rotors appeared to be powered anomalously. When approached, the model would move away at a speed of 1m/s (with a top speed of approximately 3m/s) by tilting in the relevant direction as a modern helicopter would. The model would also avoid impacting any physical barriers by keeping a minimum distance of 0.5m away from said barriers.

Note: Something just buzzed down the hallway. What was that? - JR. Kai

Input: 4kg of aluminum, 4m2 of linen.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A functional model of Leonardo da Vinci's flying machine, the Ornithopter. After the output booth was opened, it attempted to take flight but failed to lift itself off the ground. Later found to be capable of sustained flight after Senior Researcher Vivic gently threw it like a paper airplane. Cruising speed stands at a minimum of 1.5m/s and top speed measured to be 15m/s.

Note: I believe this has been the most consistent 914 has been so far! Although I now have a theory that 914 was built by Leonardo da Vinci or at least partially so, I'll first finish testing with the last of my materials and see if it gives us a secret project of da Vinci's. - Vivic

Input: 5kg of aluminum, 1m2 of linen.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A miniature tableau of two people made of aluminium, Person A is on its hands and knees with its face pushed into a pile of dirt by Person B's right foot on the back of its head. Person B appears to be in a stance of power and authority, with exaggerated eyebrows visibly displaying anger and its mouth wide open, possibly yelling at Person A. Both figures are wearing lab coats made of linen, each with the Foundation insignia embroidered on the back with aluminum wool. The faces of the models are of a lower quality and detail, resembling generic facial features of mannequins, making identification impossible.

Addendum: Further testing has shown that the model tableau possesses a cognitohazard affecting all personnel at Site-19 Facility-23 who have physically come into contact with SCP-914 and views the model. The cognitohazard invokes feelings of shame, self-disappointment and an irresistible urge to apologize to Dr. Veritas for any events involving the subject's interactions with SCP-914. As some events mentioned by personnel have not been recorded in the testing log, it is suggested that the miniature tableau is affected by a temporal anomaly. However, when the object is viewed by Dr. Veritas, [DATA EXPUNGED]. The cognitohazardous effects of the object lasts roughly 15-30 minutes after visual contact is lost, but will immediately return upon viewing the object once more.

Note: Dr. Veritas, I'd like to apologize for any and all future tests I do at your wonderful Facility and as a gift, I have left the last test output as well as a large bottle of your favourite drink in a box on your desk. I do wish great fortune upon you as well. - Senior Researcher Vivic the Unworthy

Note: I think the cognitohazard hit Vivic pretty hard. Escorting him to the medical bay now. - JR. Kai

Note: Ok… I'm reading these an hour later and man, do I hate memetic hazards. Apologies to Dr. Veritas, and I'll be keeping both da Vinci flying machines. - Vivic

Note: No, you're not. Not until the objects are thoroughly cleared of memetic hazards. Where were you going to put those anyway, your office? Thanks for the Whiskey though. Drink lots of water. Those anti-memetic treatments are going to give you one hell of a hangover in the morning. - Veritas

Test 914-0995
Name: Junior Researcher McLaif
Date: 10/09/2019
Total Items: Printed documentation of various programming languages (C 18, Java 12, brainf*ck, Python 3.8, HTML5)

Note: Documentation input into 914 always yields interesting but sometimes hazardous results. There is also the USB drive that turns your blood into coffee that contains pseudocode, so this test is to determine what 914 can do with a programming language. —McLaif

Input: Documentation for C 18.
Setting: Fine
Output: A copy of The C Programming Language, 18th edition by Brian Kernigan and Dennis Ritchie. The book contains up-to-date documentation on C 18. Of note is that no such edition of The C Programming Language exists.

Input: Documentation for Java 12.
Setting: Fine
Output: A finely detailed political-topological map of the Indonesian island of Java, in 1:1012 scale. The documentation has been cut in such a way that it mimics the geography of the island. Excess paper is strewn about in the output booth.

Note: brainf*ck is an esoteric programming language that consists of only eight commands acting upon an infinitely long tape.

Input: Documentation for brainf*ck
Setting: Fine
Output: Unchanged input. A piece of paper containing a cognitohazard that forces whoever looks at the paper to only use their last eight spoken words in speech for approximately 2 hours.

Note: Apparently my last eight spoken words were "Somebody ready nine fourteen for the brainf*ck documentation" as seen in security footage. It was interesting when I began speaking in only "nine"s. for the next minute. —McLaif

Input: Documentation for Python 3.8.
Setting: Fine
Output: A 3.8-meter long origami model of a Python molurus (Indian rock python). Upon physical contact with the model, the model began moving in the direction of the containment area doors at approximately 38 cm/s. Neutralized via H2O-9000.

Input: Documentation for HTML5.
Setting: Fine
Output: The documentation now contains new HTML tags not specified in the input, such as <liquid></liquid>. These new tags anomalously animate in the documentation, such as <fire></fire> giving a flame-like animation to anything enclosed. Manually writing these tags on the documentation itself, such as via a writing implement, does not produce this effect.

Setting: Fine
Output: A 2kg bundle of gold plated copper ribbon cable with a width of 3cm and rough length of 20m. The hydrogen canister has been turned into a stainless steel spool. Ribbon cable shows anomalously low levels of electric resistance. The copper appears to be meant for isolation, which severely reduces its usefulness for data transferring purposes.

Input: 1kg of iron, 1kg of chromium, 1kg of copper, 2L of argon.
Setting: Fine
Output: a 5kg ingot resembling beryllium bronze. However, it has gained a faint purple glow even after reforging. Alloy possesses a weak magnetic flux.

Input: 2kg of tungsten, 1kg of copper, 2L of hydrogen
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A fully functional, fully loaded handgun, with similar appearance to be Glock 18. The primary weapon frame, barrel, and firing mechanism are composed of pure tungsten, while the grip plates and iron sights are made of copper. The ammunition is also made purely of copper, with highly compressed hydrogen as a replacement of the potassium nitrate. The firearm possesses significantly more firepower and less recoil than a standard G18. It is chambered in 9mm parabellum. Sent to R&D for research.

Note: Firearm confiscated. Placed in anomalous storage. - Veritas

Input: 1kg of copper, 1kg chromium, 1kg of iron, 2L of neon gas.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One striped alloy ingot weighing exactly 3.236kg. The primary colour is grey with copper and chromium stripes every 2.46cm along the vertical axis of the ingot when at rest. Should the ingot come into contact with a subject, said subject will experience the effects of Class X Mnestics albeit temporarily until contact is broken. Bring this alloy to the Anti-memetic division immediately.

Note: I remember exactly what I had for breakfast 33 days ago, it's was bacon and eggs with orange juice, 4 strips of meat and 3 sunny side up [REDACTED for brevity] anyway… What am I holding and why? - Vivic

Input: 1kg of iron, 2L of neon gas, 3kg of chromium.
Setting: Fine
Output: One metal ingot with a weight of 4.2kg. It is an exceptional insulator of heat and glows in the presence of electricity. Max detectable range of electricity is 4.5m. Properties are not affected by reforging.

Input: 4kg of Iron, 1kg of chromium, 1kg of copper
Setting: Fine
Output: One alloy ingot weighing 6kg with a mild magnetic property that attracts biological material up to 30cm away with a strength of 200 Gauss, twice the strength of an average fridge magnet.

Input: 2L of neon gas, 2L of hydrogen gas, 2L of argon gas, 2L of helium gas, 2L of oxygen gas, 8kg of platinum, 8kg of iron.
Setting: Fine
Output: A sculpture constructed of input materials, with a wide twisting inner core made of iron and many branches of platinum every few centimetres. Located on the end of each branch are 4-6 stainless steel spheres roughly 2-4cm in diameter filled with a mixed concoction of the gasses placed in the input.

Input: 1kg of chromium, 1kg of copper, 2L of helium.
Setting: Fine
Output: A single 1.2kg alloy ingot with a tarnished copper colour. Imprinted on its surface are the words "Oxium 95% A.” Alloy noted to have high tensile strength.

Input: 1kg of gold, 1kg of copper
Setting: Fine
Output: One metal plate comprised of the two metals, imprinted is a circle stricken through, similar to a ''stop'' sign, and is hot to the touch. Cooled to room temperature after 15 minutes.

Input: 1kg of iron
Setting: Fine
Output: A sculpture of researcher Vivic being executed by [DATA EXPUNGED]

Note: Well, that's just rude! And I'll declare when I'm done testing with you, you machine. -Vivic

Input: 2kg of iron, 2kg of platinum, 1kg of gold, 2L of neon, 1kg of tungsten.
Setting: Fine
Output: A rectangular plate constructed of the above items. A strong cognitohazard affected Reseacher Vivic upon viewing, causing him to strike his head against the chamber wall until he lost consciousness.

Note: Researcher Vivic sent to medical bay after collapsing into a temporary coma, remaining log written by security guard Steven and Doctor Zane. It should be noted that no one else is affected by this output. Item incinerated. - Zane

Update: Researcher Vivic has woken up from his comatose state after roughly 12 hours. However, his mental faculties are still damaged, causing him to currently experience the following symptoms: memory loss, memetic resistance, inability to form coherent sentences, inability to balance, and slightly slurred speech patterns. Because of Vivic's current cranial and neural implants there should be no permanent lasting effects and he should regain all memories and mental faculties within 12 hours. He is to remain bedridden until such time. - Doctor Zane.

Test 914-0997
Name: Junior Researcher Steven
Date: 11/09/2019
Total Items: Two photocopies of the Voynich manuscript, three full English dictionaries

Note: I want to see if I can translate an unsolved language. With this being 914, I don't have high hopes. - JR Steven

Input: One photocopy, one dictionary.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One photocopy of the Voynich manuscript written in linear A, presumably translated, and one English to French dictionary

Note: For anyone who doesn't know, linear A is another language that is currently untranslated. - JR Steven

Input: One photocopy, one dictionary
Setting: Fine
Output: An dictionary that changes content every time it is opened. Languages are usually incomprehensible.

Test 914-0998
Name: Intern Walker, Researcher Jay
Date: 16/08/2019 - 13/09/2019
Total Items: Five 3cm³ cubes of einsteinium

Note: I'm going to try something a bit different. Jay has agreed to try to bring one cube of einsteinium every Friday. I have borrowed a hazmat suit for these tests. To prevent a nuclear explosion in the output chamber, I will not use Very Fine. - Intern Walker

Date: 16/08/2019
Input: One cube of einsteinium
Setting: Fine
Output: An einsteinium model of the moon. It glows blue in the dark, as is to be expected of this element. It has a hook at the north pole, for it to hang from the ceiling.

Date: 23/08/2019
Input: One cube of einsteinium
Setting: Fine
Output: An einsteinium bust of Albert Einstein.

Date: 30/08/2019
Input: One cube of einsteinium
Setting: Fine
Output: One dodecahedron of einsteinium. It has numbers on its faces from 1 to 12, which glow brighter than the rest of the metal. It has a very satisfying weight, and is addicting to roll. After rolling 5000 times, it has been determined that it is an extremely fair die.

Date: 06/09/2019
Input: One cube of einsteinium
Setting: Fine
Output: One tube of einsteinium. Radioactive objects that pass through it will become inert, and non-radioactive objects, including air, will become radioactive. Once the anomalous property was determined, Research Cell 109-B was evacuated and decontaminated. The output was taken off-site to be disposed of.

Date: 13/09/2019
Input: One cube of einsteinium
Setting: Fine
Output: An animate statue with a cube head. The number 99 is carved onto its head. It initially appeared to be sleeping, but when disturbed, it activated and scanned the room. When offered a piece of one of the previous outputs, it proceeded to assimilate it, then ejected material that was found to be an alloy of californium, berkelium, curium, and americium.

Note: I've been told that this matches the description of SCP-2300. I suppose that it will be taken to Site-██ for containment. - Intern Walker

Note: The fact that this didn't go horribly wrong at some point baffles me. Outputs are moved to permanent storage. - Veritas

Test 914-0999
Name: Researcher Miniwa
Date: 13/09/2019
Total items: Ten 2.5-kilogram rocks of Anthracite coal.

Input: Anthracite coal
Setting: Fine
Output: A 23.75-kilogram cube with side length 21cm of pure carbon with the atomic structure of graphite. Some gases were also detected escaping the output booth when opened.

Input: Cube from last test
Setting: Fine
Output: Atomic structure of the object has been changed that of a crystal, but still resembles a cube. Mass unchanged, side length now 18cm.

Note: Even if we wanted to sell it, we can't, because A) it's probably anomalous, and B) who would believe that we are selling a "24-kilo diamond"? - Miniwa

We should get a gemsmith to break it. Not sure how we're going to deal with the sheer size of it though. - Junior Researcher Kai

Input: Cube from last test
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Cube now resembles a common housecat. Later testing shows that the cat feeds on carbon-based objects, like coal. Testing has shown that it prefers coals with more carbon percentage over lower-carbon coals, and experiments using a diamond pencil (retrieved from storage of a previous test) show that it reacts to diamonds identically to how a normal cat reacts to catnip. Besides previously noted, cat also sleeps more than other housecats and otherwise behaves normally. Disintegrated after two hours.

eason of The Man in the High Castle.

Input: One USB drive
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A USB drive in the shape of Poland, containing an .exe program and a .txt document. The document contains a brief history of Poland in the 1983 universe. Attempts to execute the program have met with failure.

Input: The output USB drive from the 1:1 result
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A USB drive, containing a copy of the SCP-914 Experiment Logs, the floor plan of Facility-23, and the SCP-914 personnel dossier in Universe Romeo-286-Delta-23. Information requires 4/914 clearance.

Note: These point at two directions, that the SCP Foundation of that universe is suffering an internal schism, and that the SCP-914 research team of said universe is hypercompetent to such a degree that Facility-23 acts as a de facto Site on par with Site-81. - R. Zita

Test 914-1702
Name: Dr. N Rose, D-92812 (assisting)
Date: 07/09/2020
Total Items: Five empty standard aluminium flasks

Input: One of the aforementioned flasks
Setting: Rough
Output: A small crumpled pile of aluminium flakes

Input: One of the aforementioned flasks
Setting: Coarse
Output: A stack of aluminium, steel ringlet and cap

Input: One of the aforementioned flasks
Setting: 1:1
Output: An empty glass bottle. Analysis showed the bottle to be identical to bottles of Johnny Walker Whiskey. No anomalous properties manifested.

Note: How did aluminium become glass? There’s no correlation there! This thing confuses me more than medical textbooks. - Dr. Rose

Input: One of the aforementioned flasks
Setting: Fine
Output: A flask, identical to input. Item fills with a user’s favourite choice of liquor, and exhibits a cognitohazardous effect when handled, causing individuals holding it to feel an intense compulsion to drink from the flask. When the flask is emptied, the drinker will hunt for various alcoholic beverages for a varying duration between one and four hours. Output was incinerated and the D-Class involved was isolated into a sober tank for three hours.

Input: One of the aforementioned flasks
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A three litre sized flask with similar properties to SCP-109, albeit with whiskey. Chemical testing revealed a highly increased level of alcohol, reaching 72.38% alcohol by volume. During testing, D-92812 immediately collapsed after consuming the whiskey present in the output, complaining of severe nausea. D-Class expired one minute and three seconds after collapse, and autopsy results revealed the cause of death to be anomalously effective fatal liver failure. D-92812’s kidneys were also found to have developed tumours consistent with that of Stage 4 Cancer. Output was incinerated.

Note: If only the whiskey could be drunk without killing anyone who drank it. Would’ve made a good gag gift. - Dr. Rose

Test 914-1703
Name: Researcher Connolly
Date: 08/09/2020
Total Items: Three unfinished copies of The Shadow over Arcadia, an original short story written by Researcher Connolly

Input: One copy of the story
Setting: 1:1
Output: The same copy of the story, with the typeface having been changed to Comic Sans

Input: One copy of the story
Setting: Fine
Output: The same copy, now having been comprehensively proofread and edited in red ink. On the top of the first page is written “B-. Shows potential, but needs some fine tuning.” The handwriting of the edits match no personnel on file.

Input: One copy of the story
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A miniature origami model of ''Arcadia'', the city in which the story takes place. Every hour, the clock tower at the centre of the city will anomalously chime, despite it being completely made of paper with no power source detected.

Note: I have to keep this. It’s too perfect not to. - Researcher Connolly

Addendum: Item incinerated after Researcher Connolly began to react with hostility and extreme aggression in response to being asked for clarifications about the model. Researcher Connolly reprimanded and amnesticized.

Input: One flag of Bulgaria
Setting: Fine
Output: One flag of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia

Input: One agender pride flag
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A flag that spontaneously incinerated. Reviewing security footage shows that the seven bands of the agender pride flag are rearranged.

Note: We thought that it was random, until Zita assigned a letter in the word "agender" for each band, from top to bottom. The rearranged flag read "grenade". - J.R. Reimer

Input: One flag of Bulgaria
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Visually unchanged flag. Viewers would be compelled to speak in Bulgarian, and develop an intense hatred of Italian culture, Greek culture, and Greco-Roman mythology for the next three hours.

Нота: Спомнете си българския геноцид! Нека всеки град в Гърция да гори като Атина! - Младши изследовател Реймер

Note: A subsequent interview with Junior Researcher Reimer suggested that SCP-914 may be able to recall past tests, as her description of Bulgaria matched with that described in the outputs of Test 914-0871. For the record, the above note translates as "Remember the Bulgarian Genocide! May every city in Greece burn like Athens!" - Dr. Cleveland

Test 914-1705
Name: Junior Researcher Boneka
Date: 15/09/2020
Total Items: One fidget cube

Input: One fidget cube

Note: Not the content I'm looking for, but I get the rationale. - W.R. Markham

Input: One copy of In the Shadow of No Towers
Setting: Fine
Output: An untitled book, containing the exact events of 9/11.

Input: One copy of In the Shadow of No Towers
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A blank book. When held by a person who has lost a family member via non-natural causes, events of their death would appear on it. Otherwise, contents of The Good Life appear on the book, translated to the person's native language.

Test 914-1707
Name: Weapons Researcher Sam Szymons
Date: 15/09/2020
Total Items: One GSh-6-30 Rotary Autocannon, One GAU-12 Rotary Autocannon, Two GAU-19 Rotary Autocannons

Input: All aforementioned items
Setting: Fine
Output: A backpack made from materials of the input A large apparatus, with two straps made from molded metal attached to a large plate much like a backpack. On the other side of the output, two of the aforementioned autocannons are mounted on the back of the plate, aligned to point towards the ground. Feeding mechanisms for the two weapons remain intact. Live fire testing revealed a muzzle velocity of 887 meters per second, and a fire rate of 2,000 rounds per minute, similar to the input GAU-19. On the left "strap" of the outputted apparatus a title reads "Do Not Steal". There are two trigger mechanisms extruding from the straps side of the output, presumedly leading to control each weapon.

Note: A machine gun jetpack? We'll find some volunteers to test this theory. - W.R. Szymons

Addendum: D-98243 was selected for live human testing with the output. Once strapped to D-98243 and activated, he accelerated vertically at a rate of nearly 50 meters per second. D-98243 was immediately terminated upon impact with the ceiling of the secure hangar testing was performed within. Output has been placed within secure storage.

Test 914-1708
Name: Researcher A. Layton, D-14031
Date: 15/09/2020
Total Items: Fifteen 5x10x244cm Southern Yellow Pine boards, five hundred 88.9mm round head nails

Note: D-14031 will be assisting with the retrieval of experiment outputs, and was provided basic Kevlar body armor to reduce potential injuries. - Researcher A. Layton

Input: Three boards, one hundred nails
Setting: Rough
Output: A smoldering pile of charcoal, misshapen nails, and ash. Results extinguished immediately to prevent damage to the output booth; output later disposed.

Note: My apologies for the dramatics, 914 is starting things off spicy, it seems. Testing will resume once I have ventilated and cleaned the output booth. - Researcher A. Layton

[COARSE AND 1:1 TEST OMITTED FOR BREVITY]

Input: Three boards, one hundred nails
Setting: Fine
Output: A detailed 60.96 cm tall carved wooden statue of a North American porcupine (E. dorsatum) with the words “THORN PIG” carved onto the front. Quills on the back and tail of the statue are 8.89 cm in length, sharp, and composed of stainless steel. The metal quills were found to detach, as several lodged into the body armor pieces provided to D-14031 during transit to a storage container. D-14031 was treated for multiple puncture wounds on his right arm, and instructed by security to continue assisting with the experiment.

Note: The body armor helped prevent grievous injury, as a quill could have easily punctured an organ. - Researcher A. Layton

Addendum: Upon further examination, it was discovered that the Kevlar gloves issued to D-14031 were laced with clumps of small wood slivers designed to puncture the skin, which were found to originate from the porcupine carving. Output placed into Anomalous Storage after screening. Handle with extreme caution.

Input: Three boards, one hundred nails
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A seven hundred piece wooden roller coaster model kit composed of the inputted items. The fully assembled roller coaster, complete with five wood-and-metal-composite train cars, measured 240x30x40 cm. A stainless steel music box cylinder was noted to be embedded within the miniature operator’s booth. Output placed into Anomalous Storage for further testing after screening.

Note: Yellow Pine was commonly used in the construction of wooden roller coasters before the use of stronger woods were introduced. What an extremely intricate toy. - Researcher A. Layton

Addendum A: Object has cleared cognitohazard, infohazard, and memetic effect screening. The model functions anomalously, the train traveling to the lift hill every hour in an attempt to run on a continuous loop while carnival music plays. The train derails in an exaggerated fashion from the coaster track once it reaches maximum velocity, causing all operation to cease. The model does not exhibit any damage from the crash and the train can be docked at the station platform to restart the event.

Addendum B: Additional anomalous properties were discovered when it became apparent the dimensions of the model had altered in size, the track length observed increasing by 30cm every 2 hours while dormant. It seems to use random object materials like drawers, pencils and door handles for this. Consequently, track pieces are faulty, and added randomly in an attempt to fix train derailment, introducing additional errors to the model. All pieces of the model are unable to be disassembled.

Note: Due to the potential risks of a containment breach, I am halting testing immediately. I am unable to identify if the track increase is real, or if there has been a screening error. Regardless, testing has reached a point beyond my control. The train has been anchored to the track with a secure plastic cable tie. The model is perceived as operational, pausing anomalous track “growth” temporarily. The down side, unfortunately, is the music continues to play, and it is starting to sound warped and unsettling. I advise cross referencing this model with known active and decommissioned amusement park rides in the database before incineration. I will be in the medical ward if needed. - Researcher A. Layton

Note: Incinerated without incident, albeit with difficulty, since the thing almost didn't fit. - Veritas

Test 914-1709
Name: Dr. N Rose
Date: 15/09/2020
Total Items: Three ASMOL Ventolin Inhalers

Input: One of the aforementioned inhalers
Setting: 1:1
Output: One unaltered inhaler One inhaler with an aluminum canister of crude design. No anomalous properties manifested.

Input: One of the aforementioned inhalers
Setting: Fine
Output: A M67 Fragmentation Grenade. Item was tested to be non-anomalous.

Note: How did this even happen? Does it know that compressed air can be explosive? - Dr. Rose

Input: One of the aforementioned inhalers
Setting: 1:1
Output: One identical inhaler. When the item was used, it produced an anomalous effect; The user will experience oxygen deprivation while actively breathing within 47 seconds of using the output. Testing D-Class personnel expired three minutes and 51 seconds after initial use. Item was safely disposed of outside of the incinerator to prevent explosion.

Note: That poor D-Class. This may be considered a failure, but what else can we expect? I’ll be in Veritas' office because of the second test. - Dr. Rose

Test 914-1710
Name: Guest Junior Researcher Ericson
Date: 18/09/2020
Total Items: Three flash drives, each containing a copy of the entire webcode of the website 'Serina' in the form of .html files

Note: Okay, this website is basically "throw a bunch of birds onto a planet with an ecosystem that can sustain them and see what happens". - Guest Junior Researcher Ericson

Input: One of the aforementioned drives
Setting: 1:1
Output: One flash drive containing a copy of the entire webcode of the website 'Nymphicina' in the form of .html files. The premise is similar to Serina, but the domestic canary ancestor is replaced with a cockatiel ancestor.

Input: One of the aforementioned drives
Setting: Fine
Output: Similar to input, but the amount of space the website's code took up on the flash drive is noticeably larger, taking up nearly half of the space on the drive. The website retains its original name, but most of the files have more links, more images, and more information.

Note: Permission to read this while on break? - Guest Junior Researcher Ericson

Input: One of the aforementioned drives
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One automaton, in the form of a tadpole-like creature. Capable of anomalous movement in mid-air without any visible means of propulsion other than similar movements to that of a non-anomalous tadpole.

Addendum: Over the course of a week, the automaton slowly changed into a bird-like form, "growing" limbs and feathers. The automaton then "reset", transforming into its tadpole-like form.

Note: Permission to keep an eye on this? If anything fishy happens, I'll let someone know. It'll make Veritas’s life easier. - Guest Junior Researcher Ericson

Note: Keep it in one of those transparent containment lockers, see Sedna. If it escapes, the work hours of the recovery team will come out of your salary. - Veritas

Test 914-1711
Name: J.R. Regal
Date: 19/09/2020
Total Items: Three pamphlets, one about work safety, one about conspiracy theories, and one about Foundation personnel organization

Input: One pamphlet about work safety
Setting: Fine
Output: One pamphlet with unchanged text that induces extreme paranoia of potential hazards when subjects come into direct contact with it. Testing D-class attempted to exit Research Cell 109-B, citing a sudden and severe fear of SCP-914.

Input: One pamphlet about conspiracy theories
Setting: Fine
Output: One pamphlet that vastly increases suggestibility when subjects come into direct contact with it.

Note: Precautions against cognitohazards were put in place before the next test. - J.R. Regal

Input: One pamphlet about Foundation personnel organization
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One pamphlet with the Foundation logo. When held by Foundation personnel, the subject anomalously gains the ability to command other personnel of lower Security Clearance without opposition or hesitation. Output was only tested on one D-class, two security guards, and one intern.

Addendum: J.R. Regal deemed the output to be too much of a security risk and incinerated it after initial testing resulted in one intern getting affected.

Test 914-1712
Name: Researcher Hall
Date: 19/09/2020
Total Items: One non-functional PVS 7 night-vision device with no attached head mount or battery

Note: I bought this for my bug-out bag years ago, but I recently managed to drop and break it. Almost 3000 dollars down the drain, so I might as well use it for something. - Researcher Hall

Note: Reminder to all personnel that SCP-914 is not an incinerator. Take a left down the hallway, please. - Dr. Cahill

Input: Aforementioned item
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A slightly luminescent, left-handed flight glove and a matching bracelet made from an adjustable strap. When the glove is worn, the wearer's left eye will anomalously project a real-time colourized Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) stream from the point of view of the eye, albeit at very dim brightness even in low-light conditions. Wearing the bracelet with the glove will widen the field of view of the projection and amplify the brightness to levels in excess of 20,000 lumens (roughly equivalent to a 400 Watt mercury-vapour lamp). The D-Class who wore the items for testing now suffers from anomalous blindness in the left eye.

Note: Even with protection, my eyes still hurt. - Researcher Hall

Test 914-1713
Name: Weapons Researcher Markham
Date: 20/09/2020
Total Items: Two Glock 19 pistols (formerly in service of the Swiss Guards)

Input: One Glock 19 pistol
Setting: Fine
Output: One Daewoo K5 pistol. A disassembly showed that the pistol has a suppressor integrated within.

Note: That unfortunately also caused the bullets to have a far shorter effective range, effectively rendering it useless. - WR Markham

Input: One Glock 19 pistol
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A device in the shape of a cross. When activated, bullets are fired out of the longest arm of the cross at three minute intervals. These bullets demanifest after five minutes. For every bullet fired, a random chapter in the Bible is spoken by the person wielding it. Placed in Anomalous Storage.

Note: Markham is currently in the medical bay, since the thing beneath the longest arm of the cross happened to be her foot. A Bible verse sounds very strange when uttered strained with pain. - Veritas

Test 914-1714
Name: Researcher A. Layton
Date: 20/09/2020
Total Items: One BLACK + DECKER MAX Matrix brand 20v cordless drill with attached depleted lithium ion battery, one card stock cover and VHS copy of the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice, one CD and case for Greatest Hits 1992 edition compilation album by British rock band Queen

Input: One 20v cordless drill with depleted lithium ion battery
Setting: Coarse
Output: One meticulously disassembled 20v cordless drill, each piece placed on the floor of the output booth arranged according to size.

Input: One VHS copy of the film Beetlejuice
Setting: 1:1
Output: One VHS copy of the 1920 German silent horror film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari,) with the card stock cover depicting a print of the theatrical release poster. Output placed into secure storage for screening.

Note: I can see the connection here between Beetlejuice and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, as much of Tim Burton’s career is heavily influenced by German Expressionist cinema. - Researcher A. Layton

Input: One Queen Greatest Hits compilation album
Setting: Fine
Output: A visually unchanged album. A memetic effect was discovered, compelling an individual to hold the album, and sing a random song from Queen’s discography of studio albums. Once an individual stops singing, the memetic effect does not repeat upon additional viewings. Anomalous properties discovered when Researcher A. Layton took hold of the object, and proceeded to sing the lead vocals to Don’t Stop Me Now for an estimated 3 minutes. Object immediately contained, and placed into Anomalous Storage.

Note: Well, that was embarrassing. I would like to do one more test, an impromptu one, on the Very Fine setting. The output will be retrieved via a remote controlled robotic arm. - Researcher A. Layton

Input: Disassembled cordless drill from previous test
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One cordless handheld wand massager composed of the dismantled components of the previous output, which were repurposed into the objects composition. A black text label reading “914’s DEEP HURTING Series” could be identified embossed into the plastic molding.

Addendum: An auditory anomaly was discovered to manifest in the form of a voice used by an established animated character, specifically one that the subject dislikes, when the object is placed upon the skin. This voice will comment in a lecherous fashion, causing an individual to feel disturbed. After use, subjects reported complete pain alleviation in locations that suffered chronic inflammation, however the psychological trauma induced by the voices continues to escalate. Amnestics are required to mitigate the anomalous properties of the object. Output placed into Anomalous Storage.

Note: This item alleviates pain on a professional level, but the sheer cost in amnestics renders it useless for everyday use. The design could be reverse engineered easily enough, but until the anomalous properties are neutralized I would not take the risk. I may need a Class-A amnestic myself, if I have to listen to one more D-Class mention Spongebob Squarepants because of this thing I might vomit. - Researcher A. Layton

Test 914-1715
Name: Junior Researcher Boneka
Date: 22/09/2020
Total Items: Three stuffed animals

Input: One stuffed animal
Setting: 1:1
Output: One stuffed model of SCP-914. The doors have zippers and can be opened to reveal pockets in which small objects can be stored. The output is purely decorative and does not exhibit any of 914’s anomalous properties.

Input: One stuffed animal
Setting: Fine
Output: One stuffed bonsai tree. Extended testing reveals that the output anomalously behaves like a real tree and needs to be trimmed and watered regularly. While it ''grows'', it anomalously removes materials like cotton and thread in a 20 meter radius, as found out when Maintenance Technician Johnson complained about his cleaning wipes going missing.

Input: One stuffed animal
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One stuffed doll resembling JR Boneka. Testing reveals that JR Boneka will feel any sensations inflicted onto the doll, and any physical alterations made to the doll will also manifest on her body.

Note: It basically works like a voodoo doll. My name means “doll” or “stuffed animal” in my native language, so I can see the connection. I’d say to incinerate it, but I don’t want to find out what happens when you do that, so for now we’ll just put… who’s touching me—HEY! - JR Boneka

Addendum: Assigned D-Class is now in the medical bay being treated for bone fractures in the groin area administered by JR Boneka after he mishandled the output. Output placed in Anomalous Storage.

Test 914-1716
Name: Dr. Noelle Cahill
Date: 23/09/2020
Total Items: One IBM Selectric typewriter

Note: These were really popular back in the 60s and 70s. I found this one in the storage room and tried to boot it up, but found out that practically all the latches and pulleys attached to the typeball were broken. Let's see what SCP-914 can make with it. - Dr. Cahill

Input: One typewriter
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One visually similar typewriter. Notable changes include the QWERTY keyboard and internal typing elements having been replaced with Biblical Hebrew, and a modified roller that appears to grip thicker papers. The logo has also been changed to 914 Scipatronic from the original IBM Selectric. The output carries a memetic effect that causes subjects who come into contact with the typewriter to attempt to obtain klaf parchment and use the output to describe various objects in an overly-exaggerated manner. Test results with D-72813 are logged below.

Subject of Attention	Text (translated from Biblical Hebrew)
SCP-914	A most wondrous machine. No mortal mind may fully comprehend its mode of function, but we understand that it must be held in awe and respect. To be well taken care of.
One standard Foundation-issue ballpoint pen (belonging to Dr. Cahill)	The greatest of all weapons. More powerful than any sword. To be used to its fullest potential.
One IKEA LÅNGFJÅLL-series conference chair (located in Research Cell 109-B)	A most comfortable and reliable seating implement. To be upholstered with better materials as soon as possible.
Maintenance Technician Johnson	A most lovely man. To be provided with a pay raise, as soon as possible.
Dr. Veritas	XK-Class End-of-the-World trigger. To be engaged with extreme prejudice.
Addendum: After typing the last description, D-72813 attempted to attack Dr. Veritas and was immediately terminated by him via blunt force trauma with the repeated application of a standard Foundation-issue desk lamp to D-72813's cranial regions.

Note: I'm going to file an application with Facility Director Hackett on Veritas' behalf for a short Leave of Absence. The man really needs a… safer outlet for his stress. - Dr. Cahill

Note: Lucius seemed confused on why this constitutes a reason for taking time off, but he said he'd consider it if you all, and I quote: ''Could go unsupervised for over a week without killing yourselves''. I'm not sure if he was being sarcastic or not, but I'll talk to him about stress management. - Director Hackett

Test 914-1717
Name: Researcher Ivanov

Input: One 500mL beaker of liquid gallium
Setting: Fine
Output: One transparent gallium crystal suspended in a glass sphere

Note: Extraordinary! I’ve never seen anything like this. By all accounts, it shouldn’t be possible. I’m going to try something else. - Researcher Ivanov

Input: One 500mL beaker filled with chemical waste from an experiment
Setting: Coarse
Output: One pile of glass shards, five puddles of chemicals

Note: This is incredible! It managed to separate elements from a compound in roughly 5% of the time it would have taken otherwise! I’ll be right back. - Researcher Ivanov

Note: Researcher Ivanov left Facility 23 for two hours, returning in a large van that was loaded with crates of waste byproducts of various chemistry experiments from other Sites.

Tests 7-141 redacted for brevity.

Input: One 500mL beaker filled with chemical waste from an experiment
Setting: Coarse
Output: One pile of glass shards, which flew out of the output chamber at 90 km/h. Eight puddles of liquid. Notably, each test took 15 seconds longer to complete than the last, with Test 142 taking 35 minutes longer to complete.

Note: This is amazing! I’ll come back once I have more to test! - Researcher Ivanov

Input: One bottle of vodka
Setting: Fine
Output: One smashed bottle of vodka. The glass had a cognitohazardous effect that causes viewers to recite instructions on chemical decomposition. Effects wear off after 143 minutes.

Note: Sodium Chloride! Quick, grab some nails and a battery and set up electrolysis! - Researcher Ivanov

Note: Will someone please inform Researcher Ivanov to please clean up the mess from the explosion? I get that I'm the janitor and all, but please, do help me out by cleaning up after yourself. Hazmat suits are in the third right locker on the right in the Janitorial Supplies Room, and try not to damage them with broken glass. They don't grow on trees. - Janitor Molly

Test 914-1719
Name: Weapons Researcher Sam Szymons
Date: 05/10/2020
Total Items: One Luger PO8 pistol, one Glock 21 pistol

Input: Both aforementioned pistols
Setting: 1:1
Output: Two mechanically unchanged pistols. Notable changes include the slide of the Glock 21 being transplanted onto the body of the P08, while the receiver and slide of the PO8 has been transplanted onto the body of the Glock 21.

Note: The guns, once disassembled, will go back together just fine, but I'll keep them like this in my office. Screening them now. - WR. Szymons

Test 914-1720
Name: Researcher A. Lopez
Date: 05/10/2020
Total Items: Two digital portraits containing an artistic depiction of a wolf signed by JR R. Skye.

Input: One portrait
Setting: Fine
Output: A portrait of Mona Lisa depicted as a gray wolf at night with the full moon visible. The moon would emit a faint luminescence under low-light conditions.

Input: One portrait
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A portrait of a Canis lupus lupus in full detail. When observed, the output becomes animated as it depicts the behavior found in the wild. After being retrieved from the output booth by a D-Class, the wolf from the portrait would attempt to lunge towards R. Lopez's direction to no avail. When R. Lopez took the painting, the wolf exhibited symptoms akin to a tamed wolf. The portrait was cleared and passed to R. Lopez.

Addendum: No anomalous traits manifested one day after R. Lopez acquired the painting. R. Lopez reported that the wolf painting stopped moving after assuming a howling motion.

Test 914-1721
Name: Dr. N Rose
Date: 05/10/2020
Total Items: Four plastic syringes with steel needles

Note: All syringes are brand new, so there’s no possibility of biological matter in them. Two syringes will be filled with Saline, and the others will remain empty. - Dr. Rose

Input: One of the aforementioned syringes
Setting: 1:1
Output: An IV drip bag with associated needle. Bag was empty and cleared of anomalous properties.

Note: Seeing as nothing unusual manifested, it may be a good idea to send this down to the Medical Bay. - Dr. Rose

Input: One of the aforementioned syringes, filled with saline
Setting: Fine
Output: An identical syringe filled with a clear liquid. Chemical testing of the liquid indicated it to be saline, however now having gained an extreme toxicity to blood. Upon being immersed in the solution, erythrocytes anomalously begin to undergo apoptosis, characterized by rapid desiccation of the cell membrane. D-class subject injected with the saline expired in one minute and nine seconds.

Input: One of the aforementioned syringes
Setting: Fine
Output: Test was cancelled, due to accidental damage to the needle and plunger; cracks were found in the plunger, halting the mechanism, and the syringe had snapped. Cancelled on orders of Dr. Rose.

Input: One of the aforementioned syringes, filled with saline
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An identical syringe filled with saline. When held and administered by medically trained personnel, the contents of the syringe take on the properties of a dosage of whatever is required for the closest individual with an outstanding medical condition. Testing with various D-Class has resulted in the saline taking on the properties of standard saline, blood matching the blood type of the subject, anaesthetic, morphine, and oil, among others. Replacing the needle results in no change in effects. Item is currently void of saline due to testing and has been placed within Anomalous Storage.

Addendum: When the saline took on the properties of oil, the associated D-Class confessed to belonging to the Church of the Broken God. D-Class was detained and is currently on a 24 hour watch.

Note: Next time we get a pool of D-Class, each of them must be screened and any and all background info must be handed to us. The last thing we need is a 217 outbreak or one going on a killing spree after handling a potentially dangerous output. Aside from this, I want to request that the final output be tested to see if replacing the lost saline will result in the same effects. If it works, possibly screen it for use with the medical staff. Would certainly make it a lot easier to have it on hand rather than go searching for every medication under the sun. - Dr. Rose

Test 914-1722
Name: Junior Researcher Cens
Date: 11/10/2020
Total Items: Two lightsaber models from the Star Wars film franchise, one small figurine of the ''Vanguard-Class Titan BT-7274'' from the video game Titanfall 2

Input: Aforementioned Titan figurine
Setting: 1:1
Output: One small figurine of a “Tone” class Titan from the video game Titanfall 2. Upon Cens entering the output chamber, the figurine became animate and began anomalously firing small projectiles from its handheld weapon at Cens' torso, bruising him in multiple areas. Cens then proceeded to kick the figurine across the containment chamber, damaging it and removing the anomalous properties from the figurine. Projectiles collected and incinerated.

Note: Never liked Tones, anyway. They're good for the campaign and nothing else. - J.R. Cens

Note: Thanks, Cens. We were dying to learn your opinion on that. - Veritas

Input: Aforementioned Lightsaber models
Setting: Fine
Output: One 1/2 scale model of the weapon known as the ''Crucible'' from the video game DOOM Eternal. Upon touching the ''Mark of the DOOM Slayer'' engraved near the top of the hilt, the model's blade began to rapidly rise in temperature, stopping at 4256°C after 30 seconds, without emitting heat to the surroundings. Touching the Mark again caused the blade to reduce its temperature back down to room temperature. Attempting to slice an object with the edge of the blade while it is “hot” results in a clean cut. The model began to suffer from severe heat deformation and melted after 7 minutes of continuous use. Incinerated.

Test 914-1723
Name: Researcher A. Lopez
Date: 12/10/2020
Total Items: Three photographs of Researcher Lopez

Input: One photograph
Setting: 1:1
Output: One photograph depicting a young female studying at a desk near a window. The female in the photograph is wearing a school uniform. The window showed clouds outside the room.

Input: One photograph
Setting: Fine
Output: One photograph depicting an adult female studying at a desk near a window. The female in the photograph is wearing a standard Foundation uniform. The window showed a partially covered moon.

Input: One photograph
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One photograph depicting an empty desk near a window. The window showed a full moon.

Addendum: Researcher Lopez was amnesticized and reprimanded following an attempt to bite nearby personnel after viewing all three outputs together. The photographs were found to contain a memetic effect that compels the viewer to behave in a manner similar to that of a feral canine. The outputs were incinerated.

Test 914-1724
Name: Researcher Ivanov
Date: 12/10/2020
Total Items: Five 3D printers, five spools of iron wire

Note: I’m hoping to achieve a 3D printer that can make items out of metal instead of plastic, or at least make more durable prints. - Researcher Ivanov

Input: One 3D printer, one spool of iron wire
Setting: Rough
Output: One 3D printer smashed into pieces, one puddle of molten iron

Input: One 3D printer, one spool of iron wire
Setting: Coarse
Output: One disassembled 3D printer with the iron unwrapped from the spool.

Note: Nothing unusual so far. I am going to move to 1:1, Fine, and Very Fine. - Researcher Ivanov

Input: One 3D printer, one spool of iron wire
Setting: 1:1
Output: One 3D printer, one half full spool of plastic filament. Notably, all plastic parts in the printer have been replaced with metal, and the remaining metal has been shaped into a teapot. The printer is non-functional, and was incinerated.

Input: One 3D printer, one spool of iron wire
Setting: Fine
Output: One 3D printer with the metal loaded into the filament holder. Upon testing, the printer heated up and began printing molten metal. The base of the printer was anomalously capable of withstanding the heat, and a small 3D model of a gear was printed. The printer is non-compatible with all known softwares when connected to a computer, and when connected to a power source, is capable of only printing gears of various sizes. The filament holder only accepts metal filaments of the exact same composition of the original inputted wire. Output placed in Anomalous Storage.

Note: Darn, I was so sure that was going to work. I am going to try Very Fine now. Due to the molten metal from the last test, I have set up blast shields. - Researcher Ivanov

Note: On the bright side, I noticed that all the gears printed matched the gears in SCP-914. At least we now have a viable method of procuring replacement gears for SCP-914 if something gets damaged. - J.R. Kai

Input: One 3D printer, one spool of iron wire
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One anomalously stable and cool puddle of metal. One puddle of liquid metal. The output is anomalously capable of rapid movement towards other sources of metal, with the exception of SCP-914. Once it makes contact with another metal object. The output encompasses it and anomalously liquefies it, creating more liquid with the same properties. When the Output booth opened, a new Bluetooth device appeared on all Foundation equipment within Facility 23. Initial testing showed all .obj files sent to the new device would solidify out of the puddle, similar to a 3D printer. The output became aggressive once it’s volume reached 5 litres, attacking personnel and draining them of approximately 30% of their iron. The output fled into the vent system and has not been found as of today. Researcher Ivanov is in the infirmary suffering from iron deficiency.

Test 914-1725
Name: Researcher Connolly
Date: 13/10/2020
Total Items: Five coloured photographs of Researcher Connolly, smiling

Input: One photograph of Researcher Connolly
Setting: 1:1
Output: One photograph of JR Boneka, smiling

Input: One photograph of Researcher Connolly

Output: One photograph of Dr. Cahill, frowning

Note: An improvement. Funny. This gives me an idea. - Researcher Connolly

Input: One photograph of Researcher Connolly
Setting: Coarse
Output: One photograph of Researcher Connolly, dated September 8th, 2019

Note: The date of my transfer to Facility 19-23. I take it as a compliment that I’ve improved since then. - Researcher Connolly

Input: One photograph of Researcher Connolly
Setting: Rough
Output: One pile of shredded paper. Reassembling the shreds revealed it to be an image of Researcher Darby, dated March 2019.

Input: One photograph of Researcher Connolly
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One photograph of Dr. Veritas. Produces a mild cognitohazard causing his expression to appear different depending on who is looking at it. Reported expressions include: angry, disappointed, sad, frustrated, annoyed, enraged, impassive, apathetic, smug, and bored.

Note: Dr. Veritas himself declined to view the photo in question, saying ''Come bother me when you have something I can’t see in the mirror every day.'' - Researcher Connolly

Input: Output from the previous test
Setting: Fine
Output: One photograph of SCP-2632

Note: There doesn't seem to be any connection whatsoever between Dr. Veritas and 2632. It’s possible it could just be a random statement by 914 about SCPs and the people that study them. When asked about this, Dr. Veritas assured everyone that any connection between himself and an immortal humanoid SCP were simply ''rumors laughed about at the water cooler.'' - Researcher Connolly

Test 914-1726
Name: Junior Researcher Reil
Date: 13/10/2020
Total Items: One 10×10 cm piece of paper depicting a bowl of mushroom soup

Input: Above item
Setting: Fine
Output: A 10×10 cm piece of paper depicting two bowls of mushroom soup. Output has a memetic effect of causing viewers to anomalously perceive tasting mushroom soup for 5 minutes.

Note: D-54213 reported that he tasted a soup that had gone sour. I wonder if he'll fall sick. - J.R. Reil

Addendum: Exactly 91 minutes and 24 seconds after the test, D-54213 showed symptoms of food poisoning. All symptoms ceased after 24 hours.

Test 914-1730
Name: Junior Researcher Boneka
Date: 16/10/2020
Total Items: One hard drive containing various Shimeji files created by JR Boneka

Note: For the uninitiated, a Shimeji, also known as a desktop pet, is a computer program that lets a little character walk around on your computer’s desktop. You can program it to interact with pages and your cursor. I’ve been using my free time to make several of my own and decided to run a copy through 914. - JR Boneka

Input: The hard drive
Setting: Fine
Output: One hard drive containing various Shimeji files based off of various personnel employed or once employed at Site-19 Facility 23 drawn in JR Boneka’s art style.

Note: Normally, Shimejis are simply accessories and serve no functional purpose. However, after some testing on an isolated computer, it is evident that these versions outputted by 914 are more advanced, being able to interact with one another and having unique functions, depending on the character. Some are useful, some are just for fun, and some are pointless or even destructive. An incomplete list of the available Shimejis and their functions is provided below. - JR Boneka

Director Veritas	Cannot be picked up or moved with the cursor, and will swat the cursor away if this is attempted. If other personnel Shimejis are active, he will be seen giving them instructions or reprimanding them if they harm the computer in any way. Capable of terminating (but not deleting) other Shimejis that are negatively affecting the computer’s performance.
Researcher Darby	Passively causes programs to run much slower or become unresponsive and crash altogether. Attempts to alter files, including that of other Shimejis, only to delete or corrupt them on accident. Usually attempts to stay as far as possible from Dr. Veritas’ Shimeji.
Junior Researcher Kai	Automatically spellchecks and corrects any grammatical errors the user makes. Becomes irritated and ''roundhouse kicks'' the cursor if the user makes too many errors.
Junior Researcher Boneka	Attempts to follow the cursor around, demanding the user’s attention. Enjoys being clicked on. Becomes anxious and sulks in the corner of the screen if neglected. If sated, she will idle and scribble on the desktop background, or an image editing or drawing program if one is open.
Junior Researcher Angie	Keeps track of how long she is activated, and will point out when it's too late and that the user needs to sleep. If the user ignores her for too long, she will attempt to shut down the system. If she notices that the user is ignoring Junior Researcher Boneka's Shimeji for too long she will pop up in the screen and moves the cursor towards her in an attempt to have the user interact with her.
Maintenance Technician Johnson	Rearranges desktop icons into alphabetical order in descending columns, prioritizing ones that look especially out of place. Does this by picking them up and carrying them to other locations. Also capable of launching virus scans and other related computer maintenance programs without user input. When clicked on, he waves to the user and displays a smiley emoji.
Researcher MacLean	Begins self replicating rapidly upon being activated. Duplicates will occasionally be other personnel Shimejis, with identical behavior to the originals. Termination of the original will stop the replication, but will not remove the duplicates, which will instead have to be terminated individually. Capable of communication via editable text documents and is lively in personality, becoming anxious when other duplicates are removed.
Intern Scott	Displays an animation of himself playing a set of bagpipes. Traditional Scottish piping music plays through any auditory devices if available. Should the cursor take the pipes from the Shimeji, it will put on a angry face. The program will then close itself.
Researcher Laskenta	Attempts to help out at tasks the user is describing acoustically, even if no microphone is connected, by opening a terminal and entering partially misspelled commands. It is deemed to be unable to read, as it ignores both written tasks by the user and any output of the terminal.
Junior Researcher Falstaff	Moves to the corner of the screen and begins an origami folding animation. Upon completion of the animation, a origami crane sprite is added to a pile beside her, which can be picked up by the cursor. Only stops creating origami cranes when terminated, or when an origami crane is put into the recycling bin, in which case she will grow irritated and start chasing the cursor around the screen. Upon catching up with the cursor, she will throw the cursor into the recycling bin, opening it. She will then pick up the discarded origami crane and resume folding.
Weapons Researcher Markham	During nighttime, she will tell the user to look at the night sky, and opens an interactive sky chart. She is idle for most of daytime, unless the user has events stored on their calendar, in which case she provides a reminder one hour before they start. Occasionally when idle she takes her head off and places it next to her, reattaching it a few minutes later.
Network Technician Rare	Attempts to direct the user toward resources to fix various computer problems, ranging from virus removal to operating system optimization on custom-built devices, even if the user is not aware of said problems. This typically is done by opening browser windows while the user is idle and entering search terms that are pertinent to the issue it is currently focused on.
Weapons Researcher Szymons	Attempts to open any First-Person Shooter game present on the terminal. If none are available, attempts to open a browser for various weapons. Upon opening a browser window about a firearm, he will lock the user's cursor and vocalize an anecdotal story about the weapon in question. Closing the window will cause him to move to the corner of the screen and sulk.
Researcher Ken	Edits audio files through any sound-editing software in the computer in order to make them sound more aesthetically pleasing for the user by using various effects such as bass and treble, noise reduction, and sound amplification. If no audio-editing software is present, the Shimeji will open a browser and install Audacity as a default.
Intern Snevets	Capable of using Windows 10's "multiple desktop" feature, even on operating systems that have no such function. Appears to use this as a way to get away from other Shimejis, and has been found hiding on a second desktop several times.
R. Carter Williams	Can open browser windows and download images of fruit, typically apples. Images of fruit will occasionally be "consumed" by the Shimeji, and will be deleted upon consumption. Enjoys socializing and offering to share fruit with other Shimejis.
Junior Researcher van den Berg	Can open image editing programs. Whenever a drawing tablet is connected to the computer, the Shimeji pulls out a red pen and starts sketching on a clipboard. The objects disappear when the drawing tablet is disconnected from the computer.
Junior Researcher Reimer	Sets the computer’s screensavers to various vaporwave images. Capable of communication with the user via editable text documents, but will refuse to respond whenever she is addressed as Grizzly.
Researcher Connolly	Upon opening any document with multiple pages, the Shimeji will automatically “turn” the page for the reader once they have reached the bottom of the current page. If clicked after he has turned the page, he will display a smiling emoticon.
Technician Akchote	Upon launching any resource-intensive applications for video-editing, rendering or other professional use-cases, the Shimeji will advise the optimal settings for said task and provide tips on using the current application. If his advice significantly helps in the task, he expresses happiness and vocalizes the phrase: “Glad I could help!”
Dr. Nicholas Rose	Provides medical assistance to other Shimejis that are "injured" due to file corruption or being dropped. Can occasionally be seen looking at photographs, which he occasionally shows to other Shimejis. Examining the photos via file enlargement reveals them to be of various foxes.
Dr. Cleveland	When activated, he will find a literature piece on the computer and begins reading. If none are available, he searches for a random title on the internet and reads the first available version of it.
Junior Researcher Regal	Displays annoyance if the cursor interacts with him. If a Java IDE is open, he will automatically correct any syntax or semantic errors the user makes. Will also insert comments and notes into a code, attempting to describe its function, although they might be inaccurate.
Intern Beauvillier	Automatically changes the system language to French. He can be seen most of the time playing a game in the background, consuming a non-negligible amount of RAM. Any attempt to pick him up with the cursor will result in retaliation, as he will attack the cursor with a blunt weapon closely resembling a baguette.
Junior Researcher R. Skye	Occasionally pulls random work-related inspirational quotes from the side of the screen.
Researcher Lopez	If a calendar application is open, she will mark down a schedule for all four major phases of the moon for the next month.
Researcher Zita Ni	If dropped onto a webpage or document window written in a language other than Chinese or the system language, she will automatically translate the contents to Chinese. However, this is limited to languages spoken by at least 500 thousand people.
Intern Lunar	If clicked, he will pull out a kazoo plant, which plays a brief song.
Jeff the Mugcat	Opens folders and carries files out. Will run away from the cursor, forcing the user to “chase” him in order to retrieve the files.
Dr. Cahill	When clicked, opens a browser window to the Youtube video of Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up”.
Note: Hey, it is a good song. Don't look at me like that. Haven't you jammed to it before? - Dr. Cahill

Note: I should be getting back to work, but I feel extremely mesmerized watching them. It’s like a fish tank, or a very disorganized ant farm. I think I might check back on this computer from time to time and log their behaviors. Think I can get a copy of the Kai Shimeji to proofread my documents? - JR Boneka

Test 914-1731
Name: Dr. N Rose
Date: 17/10/2020
Total Items: Five Polaroid cameras

Note: I had one of these lying around my house, and thought I’d put it to good use. I bought another five, just for the test. The last one is currently being made into a lightsaber model, if you’re wondering. - Dr. Rose

[ROUGH AND COARSE TESTS OMITTED FOR BREVITY]

Input: One of the aforementioned cameras
Setting: Fine
Output: An identical camera. When a picture is taken of a living being, the resulting image contains the individual dead, with varying results from different people and in one instance, the same person twice. Image results include decapitation, lacerations to vital arteries, [REDACTED] and drowning in the subject’s blood. It is not believed that the images predict the subject’s death.

Addendum: Upon having his own photo taken, Dr. Rose was shown the resulting image, which depicted him being torn apart by a large number of foxes of multiple species. Dr. Rose immediately took the image and disposed of it via the incinerator, and proceeded to lock himself in his office.

Addendum: All further tests were cancelled on request of Dr. Rose.

Note: I don’t want to talk about it. As for the camera itself, I want this thing to be tested for any other effects, especially for cognito-/infohazardous material. No researchers or other Staff are to have their pictures taken. I’m also formally requesting a few days leave, due to trauma. That photo was… too real. - Dr. Rose

Test 914-1732
Name: Weapons Researcher Sam Szymons
Date: 18/10/2020
Total Items: One ceramic Jack-o-Lantern ornament, one OPS-CORE FAST helmet

Input: Aforementioned ornament
Setting: 1:1
Output: One rectangular Christmas present ornament, made out of ceramic.

Input: Aforementioned FAST helmet
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A hat visually resembling a witch's hat, made from composite. The output contains four articulated appendages made from the same materials as the input attached to the brim of the hat. These limbs are retractable into the brim. Upon retrieval from the Output booth, the object began to crawl onto W.R. Szymons' head with its appendages, attempting to settle on top of his head. Once fully attached to W.R. Szymons' head, the appendages retracted into the hat's brim. The output became unremovable from W.R. Szymons through anomalous means. As of now, no harmful effects have been observed from the output.

Note: I am requesting one week's leave in order to reflect on how my choices have led to this point. - W.R. Szymons

Addendum 01/11/2020: Whenever W.R. Szymons entered the facility on the first of November, output became removable from his head. No anomalous effects have been observed after removal from W.R. Szymons. Object placed in Non-anomalous Storage.

Test 914-1733
Name: Researcher Dafydd Lewis
Date: 19/10/2020
Total Items: One note with “Hi 914, I’m back!” written on it, three 100g pieces of malachite, one 100g piece of tetrahedrite

Note: I’m going to see how 914 reacts after I change out the malachite for tetrahedrite for the 1:1 test and put the output I get back in on Very Fine. – Researcher Dafydd Lewis

Input: The aforementioned note
Setting: Fine
Output: A cognitohazard that causes those who view it to recall an embarrassing memory.

Input: One piece of malachite
Setting: Rough
Output: One 100g lump of malachite showing signs of high temperature treatment

Input: One piece of malachite
Setting: Coarse
Output: A pile of copper and a pile of carbon. Both materials are part of malachite. The oxygen and hydrogen are presumed to be in the air.

Input: One piece of tetrahedrite
Setting: 1:1
Output: One piece of haematite, one piece of malachite, and one piece of antimony. Researchers present in Research Cell 109-B also reported the smell of sulphur dioxide emanating from the Output booth.

Input: One piece of malachite
Setting: Fine
Output: One polished malachite gem in a ''rectangular'' cut.

Note: I’m now putting the haematite from the 1:1 test back in. – Researcher Dafydd Lewis

Input: One piece of haematite
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One visually unchanged piece of haematite. Upon picking up the output, blood seemingly began flowing out of the haematite and the D-Class lost consciousness from general hypoxia.

Note: Ah. Haematite, or ''blood stone'' . – Researcher Dafydd Lewis

Test 914-1734
Name: Junior Researcher Boneka
Date: 21/10/2020
Total Items: 50 kg of molding clay in assorted colors

Input: 50 kg of molding clay in assorted colors
Setting: Fine
Output: One small clay car. Output autonomously drove out of the Output booth before rolling to a stop in the middle of the testing chamber. The door of the vehicle opened, and many clay figurines began to exit one by one, posing and stacking into a pyramid-like formation. Once all the clay figurines had been assimilated into the formation, they became rigid and all anomalous activity ceased. While the total mass of the output is equal to that of the input, it would have been impossible to fit all the clay figurines into the vehicle under normal circumstances. Furthermore, upon closer inspection, it is revealed that each clay figurine resembles a staff member employed at Facility 23.

Note: Ah, I get it. It’s calling this entire facility a circus. Dr. Veritas even looks like a ringmaster here. - JR Boneka

Test 914-1735
Name: Junior Researcher Reimer
Date: 21/10/2020
Total Items: A CD copy of the album Meliora by Ghost, a map of Alta California dated 1824

Input: Meliora
Setting: Fine
Output: A DVD copy of the 1990 film Ghost

Note: How did 914 manage to botch the refining process of a music album like this? - JR Reimer

Input: Map of Alta California
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A cultural map of a "Californian Empire" dated 1974, stretching from Utqiaġvik, Alaska to León, Nicaragua, with the Continental Divide forming much of its eastern boundary. Notably, Fort Ross and Monterey are designated as the summer and winter capitals of the nation respectively.

Note: The D-class who handled the output began speaking a hybrid language that incorporated Russian, Spanish, English, Navajo, and Nahuatl words and grammar. The output itself has been placed into anomalous storage, while a non-anomalous copy of the map has been made available. Investigation into the language is ongoing. - JR Reimer

Test 914-1736
Name: Dr. Noelle Cahill
Date: 24/10/2020
Total Items: Three Christmas albums from assorted artists in CD format

Note: The music store in the nearby town has already begun selling these, despite Halloween not being over yet. Got three for the price of one, which says a lot about how much CDs are worth these days. - Dr. Cahill

Input: One More Drifter in the Snow by Aimee Mann
Setting: Fine
Output: Get Wet In Deep Space by Constellation Starfish

Note: Incinerated. Where does SCP-914 even get Fifthist infection material from? - Dr. Cahill

Input: The Ultimate Motown Christmas Collection by Motown Records
Setting: Fine
Output: One miniature figurine of a man with a large afro, made from the inputted materials. The output is anomalously capable of playing the same songs as those on the input despite the lack of a visible power source or sound generator, albeit at an average volume of below 30 dBA.

Note: This would make for an excellent centrepiece for Christmas dinner. I'll be keeping it if it passes anomaly screening. - Dr. Cahill

Input: A Jolly Christmas From Frank Sinatra by Frank Sinatra
Setting: 1:1
Output: Elvis' Christmas Album by Elvis Presley

Note: You must have miswrote “Rough” as “1:1” for the last output, Dr. Cahill. - Researcher Connolly

Test 914-1737
Name: J.R. Kai
Date: 24/10/2020
Total Items: One padded box of six Zalto hand-blown universal wineglasses

Input: Box of wineglasses
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Two large glass tumblers, one bottle sleeve

Note: I've put the outputs through every single test we have in this Facility and not a single anomaly has shown up. This is either the best prank ever by SCP-914, or we really just got a pair of non-anomalous tumblers and a bottle sleeve from a Very Fine test. - J.R. Kai

Addendum: D-91753 and D-13094, personnel with a history of alcohol consumption, were loaned the outputs for use in an empty multipurpose room converted to an observation chamber. One bottle of generic red wine was provided and D-91753 was instructed to place the bottle sleeve over it. No anomalous effects were observed. Both D-class reported no anomalous effects on the wine after it was poured into the tumblers, though D-13094 managed to catch the bottle after it slipped out of the sleeve.

Test 914-1738
Name: Junior Researcher Simon Seals
Date: 28/10/2020
Total Items: Five flags and accompanying flagpoles

Note: Morning, all. I was recently transferred to the Site and decided I'd contribute a bit to testing with this particular SCP. Some work colleagues were happy to donate the following items, so I shall be using those for these first tests. - JR Seals

Input: One flagpole flying the flag of Greece
Setting: Rough
Output: Shards of metal and strips of fabric. Mass equal to that of the input. Materials show signs of simply being smashed or torn apart.

Note: Every indication from previous tests is that this is normal for this particular setting, so nothing out of the ordinary just yet. - JR Seals

Input: One flagpole flying the flag of the United Kingdom
Setting: Coarse
Output: An unchanged flagpole. The flag itself has been separated into three different flags identified as Saint George's Cross, the Cross of Saint Patrick and the Saltire of Saint Andrew, all of which represent the nations that formed the original Kingdom with England, Ireland and Scotland being represented respectively.

Note: Interesting historical footnote by 914. Moving on. - JR Seals

Input: One flagpole flying the flag of Israel
Setting: 1:1
Output: A miniature dumpster formed from the metal of the inputted flagpole, with two small flags hung in front of it, being the flag of Israel and the flag of Palestine. The dumpster itself burst into flames upon the output door opening and was unable to be extinguished.

Note: An… accurate, if simple summary of contemporary events, I suppose. That said, I was expecting a religious inference as opposed to political commentary. - JR Seals

Input: One flagpole flying the flag of the United States of America
Setting: Fine
Output: An unchanged flag and flagpole. The same flag and flagpole. Upon closer examination, the flag itself was found to have an additional 10 stars placed on it alongside the original 50. Output found to contain a memetic hazard causing any individuals of American origin within 20 metres of the output to experience feelings of irritation and annoyance to individuals of Canadian origin. Effects of the memetic hazard develop over time the longer affected individuals remain within the radius, evolving to anger and outright aggression. These emotions ceased upon leaving the 20 metre radius of the output. Output incinerated.

Input: One flagpole flying the flag of Australia
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An animate 1:2 scale model of one Dromaius novaehollandiae (Emu) constructed from the materials of the input, with its main body composed of the materials of the flag, including coloring, and its feet and beak composed of the metals from the flagpole. Output was hostile and contained a cognitohazard that induced severe ornithophobia within individuals that observed it. Output destroyed by security and subsequently incinerated after causing minor injuries to personnel.

Note: I- Ugh. Ahem, no comment. - JR Seals

Addendum: After the final test, JR Seals was seen undergoing Class-A amnestic treatment in the Facility infirmary.

Test 914-1739
Name: J.R. Regal
Date: 28/10/2020
Total Items: One USB flash drive containing the text adventure game “Zork III: The Dungeon Master”.

Input: One USB flash drive containing the text adventure game “Zork III: The Dungeon Master”
Setting: Fine
Output: One USB flash drive containing an executable file named "The SCP-914 experience". Upon initiating the program a title screen will be displayed in the same font as the one used in the original program and with the same text display during gameplay.
The game starts with an explanation that SCP-914 is being tested by the Foundation and that the player can choose how to interact with the researchers and their tests, from there the player is presented with various tests where they are given information about the researcher or D-class, the settings and the inputs which the user is compelled to use to create an output describing its effects if any, and see how the researchers use, test, or destroy it in a recreation of a standard SCP-914 test log. Personnel can be killed, fired, or relocated through specific outputs, or random events, some of which appear to be related to how the player interacted with them. As the game progresses any patterns or significant changes affect the tests by the in-game researchers according to their personalities and their relationship with other affected personnel. Current personnel are referenced or appear in notes but won't make any tests.
The output had been clear of any cognito or infohazards.

Note: The game maintains an incredible amount of consistency with how researchers react or the consequences for use or misuse of the outputs given. The logs are so well made that they could be mistaken by real ones. - J.R. Regal

Addendum: After reviewing the test logs, to check if the logs generated by the output correspond to any real ones, it was discovered that some blank tests have been filled with information matching the logs generated. Memory alteration effects were discovered when interviewing personnel related to the generated logs when they recounted the test performed in the output.

Note: Even though this output will probably be incinerated to avoid complicating the review of our records it does make me wonder if SCP-914 could work in an analogous way. - J.R. Regal

Test 914-1740
Name: J.R. Evangeline Perry
Date: 28/10/2020
Total Items: One handheld Nintendo 3DS R4 cartridge containing a variety of Nintendo games

Input: One R4 cartridge containing a variety of Nintendo games
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One R4 cartridge containing a variety of original games based on personnel employed in Site 19-23.

Director Veritas	Manage The Dimwits	The goal of the game is to spot and correct any rule being broken by any of the employees, which move around the map randomly. If not spotted in time, the facility takes damage. Every day, or level, more rules are added. The game allows for fewer mistakes every level. No one has beaten it thus far, although Dr. Veritas made the most progress.
Junior Researcher Evangeline	The Foundation Project	A casual Facility management game, where the player is able to design and decorate a Foundation Facility, including options like furniture, lighting and what the employees wear. Employees may be hired or leave depending on how much the player interacts with them. The player can give other employees in their Facility gifts, which will elicit a positive or negative reaction depending on the gift and their personality type. Dr. Veritas will not accept gifts.
Junior Researcher Kai	Let's Play A Little Game	For every grammatical error spotted in a given text file, the player is rewarded with bonus time. If the player fails to correct the entire text file at the end of the allotted time, an animation of Junior Researcher Kai kneecapping the player with a pipe wrench is displayed. It is currently unknown how the game is capable of obtaining a 100% accurate 3D-render of the player, despite verification confirming that the game had not accessed the Nintendo 3DS camera during gameplay.
Junior Researcher Boneka	Fuwa Fuwa Bonbon Adventure!	A 2D pastel pixel platformer in which the player, playing as JR Boneka, has to traverse a country and rescue her stuffed animal friends who have been kidnapped by dark forces. The player is able to collect rare candies that function as power-ups, as well as use a magic drawing pad to summon other personnel to assist her throughout the game, such as JR Evangeline and JR Kai. After the main storyline is completed, the player is given access to new game modes, including a baking minigame, a friend sim, and a dress-up minigame.
Researcher Connolly	The Time Traveler's Researcher	A historical themed trivia game. Different characters, each one an employee of Site 19-23, are trapped in various historical moments in time. By answering enough trivia questions about the events taking place at that time, the characters are rescued and are unlocked as playable characters. Confirmed characters include Researcher Connolly during the First World War, JR Kai during the Three Kingdoms period of China, Intern Beauvillier during the French Revolution, Dr. Cleveland during the Dominican War of Independence, and Researcher Rasclon during the settlement of New South Wales. Notably, some of the events in the game are noted to have occurred only in alternate universes or possibly the future, such as Intern Scott in the Scottish Independency Wars and JR Boneka in the War of Thorns taking place in the 2040s.
Intern Scott	Call of the Highlander	A 2D "side scroller beat 'em up" which is set in early medieval times. The game has the player control Intern Scott as he tries to defeat the evil king of England using swords and other weaponry to defeat enemies on various levels culminating in a final battle with the King. Different swords and weapons can be unlocked by passing bonus levels which include hunting criminals and a realistic mode, which makes all weapons do double damage.
Junior Researcher Reimer	Edge of Yesterday	A simplified first person shooter set in the 2040s. The game follows a group of survivors led by Louise "Grizz" Reimer, as they strive to survive and fight their way out of hordes of zombies. The default player character is only described as a person in their twenties. Occasionally, other playable characters, based on various Facility-23 researchers, would appear. When rescued, the player may play as those characters.
Researcher MacLean	M4: MacLean’s Microgame Mega Mix	A collection of “microgames” that increases in speed and difficulty as time passes. The Microgames consist of mini-games stolen from the WarioWare franchise, the Rhythm Heaven series, and the Mario party series, with the controls modified to be compatible with the 3DS. Also included are an unknown amount of original microgames including various researchers from Facility-23. Players are encouraged to complete as many microgames as possible, to obtain a “winning streak”, where initials are inputted similar to an arcade game’s high score board. Over 2000 individual microgames have been seen, and more are currently being catalogued.
Intern Beauvillier	French the world!	An action RPG game in a fantasy/sci-fi world. The player is depicted as a young French hero, wielding a tremendously massive baguette, aiming to conquer the world and unite the whole planet under the French flag. At times, the narrator, voiced by Intern Beauvilier, will provide help to the player via either a riddle or a sarcastic comment.
Dr. Nicholas Rose	Medical Malpractice	A game much like ''Surgeon Simulator''. The player is confined to the Site 19-23 Medical Ward and forced to perform various surgeries and other medical practices of varying difficulty of patients. Said patients are modeled versions of Site 19-23 Staff. The player must successfully complete each surgery, and will lose the game should the patient bleed out or run out of time; time varies for each surgery however. Procedures include Heart Transplant, Hysterectomy, Bone Marrow Extraction and a Sex Change.
Junior Researcher Regal	Regal Emblem	A tactical role-playing game based around recruiting researchers and other notable personnel while advancing through a Facility-23 under attack by several GOI in order to repel the attack. Characters will have scenes interacting with each other if they have been deployed in battle together and have certain levels of affinity.
Weapons Researcher Szymons	Poland Can Into Tank	A puzzle game taking place within a tank factory. Player is tasked with putting together increasingly redundant tank parts to create a functioning vehicle. Initial playthroughs display it to be unnecessarily difficult due to many provided parts being useless. Occasionally, W.R. Szymons will be displayed with a small text bubble, offering somewhat useless and anecdotal advice to the player.
Researcher Ken	Krazy Karaoke	A rhythm game consisting of Researcher Ken touring with band members, each an employee of Site 19-23 and manually selected, playing songs consistent with Researcher Ken's Spotify playlist at various fictional performance arenas. Consists of 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium and Hard; with each difficulty increasing the frequency of button inputs.
Note: There are so many good games on this cartridge! After trying to gift Dr. Veritas five times in a row he locked his office for three days. - J.R. Evangeline

Test 914-1741
Name: WR Markham
Date: 30/10/2020
Total Items: Two USB flash drives containing the speculative fiction 17776, two QSB-91 knife pistols.

Input: One USB flash drive containing 17776
Setting: 1:1
Output: One SD card containing Welcome to Night Vale

Input: One QSB-91 knife pistol
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Type 82-2 knife pistol

Note: To be fair, knife pistols are nowhere near the mainstream, so I do expect some predictability. - WR Markham

Input: The output SD card
Setting: Fine
Output: One USB flash drive, seemingly empty upon insertion to a standalone computer. When connected to a device for more than 215 seconds, an interactive map of the southwestern United States is opened, with anomalous incidents that happened between 2016 and 2019 highlighted. Information on the USB flash drive is deemed inaccurate upon further review.

Input: One QSB-91 knife pistol
Setting: Fine
Output: One PSM pistol, optimised for effective firing range, plus eight extra bullets of the 5.45×18mm cartridge.

Input: One USB flash drive containing 17776
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Eight Micro SD cards, each one anomalously containing ██ zettabytes of data. When inserted to a standalone computer, it shut down after exactly 910 seconds. Upon rebooting, the computer initiated contact, claiming to be the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft. Computer and all micro SD cards placed in Anomalous Storage.

Input: The output Type 82-2 pistol dagger
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An open metallic circle. When open, miniature bullets can be fired from the circle. When clasped together, a blade manifests in the circle, cutting through whatever was contained in between.

Note: Thanks, but no thanks. I already ended up as the headless horsewoman last year. Back in the intake it goes. - WR Markham

Input: Above output
Setting: Coarse
Output: A miniature metallic decorative pumpkin, with a blade forming its stem, and a bullet inside of it. Output has been determined non-anomalous.

Test 914-1742
Name: Dr. Nightingale
Date: 30/10/2020
Total Items: Two foam decorative pumpkins, three paper notes

Note: Trying to get into the Halloween spirit. I wonder if SCP-914 is in the mood for this time of year as well. I gathered a handful of decorations that will hopefully result in some tricks and treats. - Dr. Nightingale

Input: One foam decorative pumpkin
Setting: Fine
Output: One foam decorative pumpkin, hollowed out and carved to resemble a stereotypical “buck-toothed” jack-o-lantern. Upon being placed into a darkened room, it was observed that the pumpkin developed an anomalous glow from within its interior, similar in illumination to that of a small tealight candle. No hazardous properties found. Placed into the employee break room.

Input: One foam decorative pumpkin
Setting: Fine
Output: One foam decorative pumpkin, hollowed out and carved to resemble a stereotypical “buck-toothed” jack-o-lantern. Carvings were noted to change each time they were not being observed, gradually growing more threatening in appearance. The original “buck-toothed” face was replaced by one with serrated teeth, one that gave the appearance of screaming, one that realistically depicted a human skull, etcetera. Personnel reported feeling uncomfortable while viewing subsequent carvings. Output incinerated once the carvings began changing into depictions of the facial features of numerous SCPs.

Note: Since the “treats” part of this worked out fairly well, I now will be trying for the “tricks”. - Dr. Nightingale

Input: One piece of paper with “Something that will scare Dr. Veritas.” written on it in No. 2 pencil
Setting: 1:1
Output: One piece of paper, crudely cut-out and shaped to resemble a “sheet ghost”. “Researcher Darby” is scrawled across the front of the ghost in No. 2 pencil. No anomalous properties observed. Output vanished shortly after being removed from the testing chamber. Re-discovered approximately three hours later by Dr. Veritas after it dropped down in front of them upon entering their office. Destroyed by firearm when Dr. Veritas interpreted this as a hostile ambush. The bill for removing the bullet hole from the office ceiling has been forwarded to Dr. Nightingale.

Input: One piece of paper with “Something that will scare SCP-914.” written on it in No. 2 pencil
Setting: 1:1
Output: One piece of paper with a No. 2 pencil drawing of SCP-914. The drawing depicts SCP-914 half-buried in a landfill, noticeably run-down and displaying signs of rust, crushing, and overall neglect. No anomalous properties observed.

Input: One piece of paper with “Something that will scare Dr. Nightingale.” written on it in No. 2 pencil
Setting: 1:1
Output: One piece of paper with “They are never going to let you see her again.” written on it in No. 2 pencil. Dr. Nightingale was observed to become visibly agitated upon reading the note, and further testing was halted on his orders. No anomalous properties observed.

Test 914-1743
Name: Junior Researcher Boneka
Date: 31/10/2020
Total Items: Three plastic pumpkin-shaped trick-or-treat baskets

Input: One trick-or-treat basket
Setting: 1:1
Output: One bowl, presumably for serving candy.

Input: One trick-or-treat basket
Setting: Fine
Output: One cauldron-shaped trick-or-treat basket that began anomalously filling up with candy upon being removed from the Output booth. Whenever candy is removed from the basket, more will appear to take its place.

Note: Further investigation reveals that the basket will take whatever candy is closest to it as to constantly remain full. I’m relieved that we figured that one out, because we were about to get up in arms about who took all the candy from the bowl that was set up in the break room. - JR Boneka

Input: One trick-or-treat basket
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One hollow replica of a severed human head. When a piece of candy is inserted into its mouth, it will become animate for a short period of time during which it will consume the candy and then vocalizing something at random before becoming inanimate again. Vocalizations so far have ranged from Halloween-themed songs to biographies about various serial killers to continuous screaming. Output terminated by security personnel and subsequently incinerated.

Test 914-1744
Name: Intern Snevets
Date: 31/10/2020
Total Items: Three flash drives, each containing a copy of a simple C#/.NET console program that uses the Console.Beep() method to play a simplified version of the song “Spooky Scary Skeletons”

Note: I’ve been too busy working on my degree to do much testing recently, but I had some free time today and decided to apply for a slot. It’s been a while, everyone. - Intern Snevets

Input: One flash drive
Setting: 1:1
Output: A flash drive of different make, containing a similar program which seems to simply play “Spooky Scary Skeletons” in a different key.

Note: The key for this version is actually the same as a parody of the song by Senzawa. - JR Boneka

Note: That seems like it could be a Coarse output to me. - Intern Snevets

Input: One flash drive
Setting: Fine
Output: The same flash drive. The program has been modified to allow audio to be mixed in a buffer of sorts, allowing both “vocals” and multiple instrumental channels of the song to play at the same time. However, the audio loops infinitely and the program runs in the background, so Task Manager is required to terminate it.

Input: One flash drive
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An SD card in a plastic case. Contains a program which, when run, appears to open an empty terminal window.

Addendum: After approximately half an hour, four animate, intact, complete human skeletons with no remaining flesh entered the facility, approached the test computer running the program, and began dancing to music that the program started playing upon their arrival. The skeletons deanimated once the music stopped, and efforts are being made to determine their source and return them to their proper resting places.

Note: For clarity, we did not just let them in. They broke the locks on the front doors, and security personnel that attempted to hold them down just got dragged across the floor. - Agent Sedna

Test 914-1745
Warning: Access to this test log is restricted to Clearance Level 3

Name: Intern Francois Beauvillier
Date: 31/10/2020
Total Items: Three glass syringes containing Class-C amnestics

Note: A friend in the R&D department at Site-██ asked me to try this in order to get a more effective variant of amnestics. They recently found a particular cognitohazard which has effects that can't be mitigated with Class-C amnestics, so they thought SCP-914 could help. Oh, by the way, happy Halloween to you all. - Intern Beauvillier

Input: One of the aforementioned syringes
Setting: Fine
Output: An unchanged syringe containing an unknown compound

Note: The lab analysis revealed that it has similar effects as that of a Class-C amnestic, but effective for a much longer period. They said it could be useful, but unfortunately, it wasn't the effect they were looking for. - Intern Beauvillier

Input: One of the aforementioned syringes
Setting: Fine
Output: An unchanged syringe containing Class-X mnestics

Note: Still not what they're looking for. But as my grandmother used to say, "Third time's the charm." - Intern Beauvillier

Input: One of the aforementioned syringes
Setting: Fine Very Fine
Output: One miniature glass vial containing an unknown compound

Note: Turned the dial a bit too far. Well, it might work, so let's see what we get. - Intern Beauvillier

Addendum A: Upon retrieval, Intern Beauvillier accidentally dropped the vial. After breaking, the contained liquid instantly evaporated. Filtration systems in the ventilation system did not seem to have detected any anomalies. Notably, Intern Beauvilier was reported missing after the following note was logged, leaving behind his personal computer.

Note: My hand slipped, but it looks like nothing happened. A bit concerning for a Very Fine output, but I wouldn't worry over nothing. - Intern Beauvillier

Addendum B: A copy of the audio logs from Intern Beauvillier's computer has been attached below for investigation purposes.

ENTRY 1: 31/10/2020
I tried to give my report to Dr. Veritas, but he's not here. After looking around it seems everyone is gone. I wonder if I missed a PSA. I don't have anywhere to go anyway, so I guess I'll stay here.
Beauvillier, signing out.

ENTRY 2: 31/10/2020
I'm starting to get a little worried. I tried to contact the other researchers, but nobody answered. The Facility is awfully silent. It's a bit uncomfortable, but I guess it happens. Perhaps there's a network outage around here, and that's why I can't contact anyone. I guess I'll get more data tomorrow.
Beauvillier, signing out.

ENTRY 3: 01/11/2020
Alright, it's been a day now and nothing happened, I still can't reach anyone. I'll try to leave the Facility and go to Fort Lauderdale. I'm getting more and more worried about this. I'll make an update once I'm there.
Beauvillier, signing out.

ENTRY 4: 01/11/2020
I'm at Fort Lauderdale now. Still no one around. I saw no cars on the way there, and nobody in the town. Everything is closed and silent. A bit too silent. I'm not feeling well, I'm getting back to the Facility.
Beauvillier, signing out.

ENTRY 5: 02/11/2020
Second day of loneliness. I'm starting to think this vial I broke wasn't completely inoffensive. SCP-914 is at it again, huh? I'll try to study the glass shards, see if I can get any data out of them.
Beauvillier, signing out.

ENTRY 6: 02/11/2020
I have good news and terrible news.
First off, I found something about the glass shards. It seems some of the liquid condensed on the glass, and it gives me a sample to study. It's useful, but here comes the bad news: the power cut out. I mean, the Facility still has backup power, but the emergency generator isn't made to last years, months, or even weeks. If I can get a few days out of it, I'll be happy. Since all the power it outputs is used for essentials, I can't recharge my laptop. My journal entries might be a little more sporadic.
Beauvillier, signing out.

ENTRY 7: 04/11/2020
I knew it.
As expected, the power didn't last.
I am extremely worried. We're in a Facility containing only a safe skip. But in the main Site-19, things might be a little messier. I hope they're doing okay over there.
In the meantime, after exploring thoroughly the surroundings of the facility, I have concluded that there are no living humans in a 50km radius.
I'll keep looking for people.
Beauvillier, signing out.

ENTRY 8: 08/11/2020
That's it. I'm getting out. My laptop's at 25%, the power's out, and the perishables are rotting. Nothing's keeping me here. I'll take the glass shards, some food, and a weapon from the armory.
I tried to contact Site-19 via the emergency channels I found while snooping around some restricted areas on the inner network. If any high-up sees this, I hope you'll understand. I digress. The point is, I didn't get any answer.
I'm leaving tomorrow for the main Site-19. I'll probably give updates once I'm there.
Beauvillier, signing out.

ENTRY 9: 24/11/2020
I didn't think it'd take me so long to figure this out, but given the fact that most people working at Site-19 don't even know where Site-19 is, and that I had to look around some archived content to pinpoint its location, I guess two weeks is a pretty short period.
Well, I should've guessed where it was earlier, since Site-19 is now a big flaming crater in the ground, as is the land around it for miles and miles. I guess, since I saw absolutely nobody on the way here, that this phenomenon has affected the whole planet, and that I am alone on Earth. I deserved it, for making a test with amnestics on Very Fine and on Halloween. Anyway, some skips must've breached containment and the automated defence protocols must've triggered the on-Site nuclear warheads. I'm back to square one. I'll get back to Facility 23, since I have an idea that might just work, and I don't plan on staying around for the nuclear winter.
Beauvillier, signing out.

ENTRY 10: 07/12/2020
Home sweet home. I'm finally about to put my plan to execution.
Basically, I'm putting those glass shards back through 914 on Very Fine. It's the last idea I have. If it fails, I guess I'll have to resort to other alternatives, I don't want to live alone for the rest of my life.
Anyway, here goes nothing. I hope it works.
Beauvillier, signing out.

Addendum C: When Intern Beauvillier reappeared while appearing to be in a coma, a test log was found in his pocket and has been attached below for investigation purposes.

Name: Intern Francois Beauvillier
Date: 07/12/2020
Total Items: One broken vial (result of the last experiment from 31/10/2020)

Input: Aforementioned broken vial
Setting: Very Fine
Output:

Note: I'm breaking this one intentionally. If this doesn't wor I hope this works. It has to. - Intern Beauvillier

Note: After Francois Beauvillier reappeared on 07/12/2020 in Research Cell 109-B while in a comatose state, he was transferred to the medical bay and was awoken on 10/12/2020. He was administered amnestics immediately and new memories were created. All data pertaining to this incident shall remain redacted as learning about this could possibly cause permanent brain damage and psychological trauma. I do not recommend testing with amnestics in the near future, and an investigation is currently ongoing to find out what exactly happened, but until we finally know everything about this case, I urge all personnel involved to remain silent. - Facility Director Hackett

UPDATE: Lucius has suggested that we amnesticise all personnel involved. After talking it over with him, we decided that it won't be necessary for all personnel with access to this test. Disciplinary actions will follow, however, if discretion is not exercised. - Facility Director Hackett

Test 914-1746
Name: Dr. Maria Thompson
Date: 01/11/2020
Total Items: One picture of a jack o' lantern

Input: One picture of a jack o' lantern
Setting: 1:1
Output: One picture of an orange skull

Input: Above output
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One picture of a Christmas tree. When held, the song "All I Want for Christmas Is You" by Mariah Carey would play at around 35 decibels.

Note: At first, there were claims of people hearing the song. After further testing, it was confirmed that the song "All I Want for Christmas Is You" did play quietly. - Dr. Terren

Input: Above output
Setting: Fine Very Fine
Output: One haiku

Note: After testing it, we found an anomaly, makes us write haikus. - Dr. Thompson

Test 914-1747
Name: Dr. N Rose
Date: 04/11/2020
Total Items: Six sculptures resembling foxes comprised of wood, each weighing 0.5kg

Note: I’m back after the last ordeal. As for the sculptures, they are made from ironbark wood, a native of Australia’s Eucalyptus genus. Don’t expect any gifts; I have none left after this. - Dr Rose

Input: One of the aforementioned sculptures
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of woodchips and wood-dust

Input: One of the aforementioned sculptures
Setting: Coarse
Output: A cube of wood in equal weight of the input. The cube appears to be roughly formed.

Input: One of the aforementioned sculptures
Setting: 1:1
Output: A wood sculpture of a wolf in a howling stance.

Note: Provided this passes screening, I might give this to Lopez. - Dr Rose

Input: One of the aforementioned sculptures
Setting: Fine
Output: An animate wood sculpture of a fox. Subject acted like any member of its biological basis, though it did not require nutrition or need to defecate. Subject was also non-aggressive to personnel, allowing for itself to be held and petted, and was notably playful. Subject is currently held in Anomalous Storage.

Input: One of the aforementioned sculptures
Setting: Fine
Output: An identical sculpture. When the subject was held by D-█████, they stated they could hear the sound of a fox’s laughter. Three minutes and two seconds after holding, the D-Class began to emit vocalisations akin to those of a fox. This has not ceased, even after releasing the sculpture. Examination of the D-Class’ brain activity revealed no change in neural activity, though a physical examination revealed that his larynx had been anomalously changed to one identical to that of a fox. Item was incinerated, and the D-Class returned to their holding cell.

Note: Quite unusual, even for 914’s standards. I wish for the D-Class to be interviewed for any other telepathic vocalisations and possibly be taught ASL. - Dr Rose

Input: One of the aforementioned sculptures
Setting: 1:1
Output: One sculpture of a fox head and a small pile of wood shavings. Closer examination reveals the head to be identical to that of a Common Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes), and carved with extreme detail. No anomalous properties manifested and passed screening.

Note: If I may, I wish to keep this. The craftsmanship is insanely good, and it might make a good gift to my wife. - Dr Rose

Note: Sure! While you're at it, interested in a safe class anomalous item for your kid's birthday? It's going to anomalous storage. - Veritas

Test 914-1748
Name: Dr James Adam
Date: 14/11/2020
Total Items: Two USB drives with a copy of the video history of the entire world, i guess by Bill Wurtz

Input: One USB drive as mentioned above
Setting: 1:1
Output: A USB drive containing 19 minutes and 26 seconds of clips similar to the style Bill Wurtz uses in his videos; however, none of these clips were ever posted by Bill Wurtz.

Input: One USB drive as mentioned above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A USB drive with over 4 terabytes of storage with an ever growing video clip labelled True History of the World, I guess by [REDACTED]. There is no known system of determining what time on the video corresponds to a date and time that is usable. However at the time of [REDACTED] the video ceases to focus on all events and only on events that occur within the view of Earth.

Addendum: The video itself does contain commentary, however the commentary is spoken in an unknown language, the video is made of clips that are animated in a style similar to Bill Wurtz, even though the commentary is spoken in a unknown language the text itself seems to change depending on who views it, translating itself into the persons primarily used language, if two people with different primarily used languages are watching the video it will stop all audio and pause the video.

Test 914-1749
Name: Sr. Researcher Vil
Date: 17/11/2020

- Hide 175X Test Logs
Test 914-1750
Name: Intern Scott
Date: 17/11/2020
Total Items: Three 18mm thick sheets of cedar wood, three packs of guitar strings

Note: Had these left over when I was making my own acoustic guitar. - Intern Scott

Input: The sheets of wood, the strings
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One stringed wooden musical instrument. The wood appears to have been morphed and shaped into a mass of stringed instruments merged together. Next to each string appears to be a "finger" made of wood with two joints.

Addendum: Approximately one hour after the instrument was placed in anomalous storage, the "fingers" started to pluck and stroke the strings making "music". Personnel listening to the "music" reported feeling relaxed and content. The music continued for approximately five minutes before ceasing and the "fingers" returning to their previous position.

Note: This is very interesting. We could keep this in D-Class residence so that they calm down every once in a while. - Intern Scott

Addendum: The instrument triggers an auditory cognitohazard causing listeners to avoid basic instincts such as eating or sleeping. Intern Scott was subjected to this for three days, neglecting work and hydration. Intern Scott was then forcefully brought to the infirmary for hydration and amnestic therapy. The instrument was incinerated.

Test 914-1751
Name: Junior Researcher R. Skye
Date: 23/11/2020
Total Items: One extra-large inflatable globe, three separate issues of a conspiracy theory magazine, printed from an online source.

Input: One conspiracy theory magazine
Setting: Fine
Output: Upon inspection, all conspiracies mentioned in the inputted magazine were reframed as historical facts in the output, with the input's topic of the month being about secret government experiments. D-25521 was instructed to read the magazine and after an hour of doing so, claimed to be a "Dr. Heimich" from a "Science Cooperative Registry Division" and requested to be amnesticised. No such organization exists in Foundation records and the output was incinerated while D-22521 was amnesticised and dismissed.

Input: One extra-large inflatable globe, two conspiracy theory magazines
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One thick hardbound book made from inputted plastic and paper. After D-22134 picked up the output, he began to ignore all instructions given by researchers, instead exclaiming gibberish about knowing "the secrets of Area 51", then walking towards and colliding with a wall in the opposite direction of the United States Air Force facility commonly referred to as Area 51. Regained consciousness, amnesticised and dismissed.

Test 914-1752
Name: Researcher J. E. Bernabad
Date: 29/11/2020
Total Items: Four 300 millilitre glass cups

Input: One of the aforementioned glass cups
Setting: Rough
Output: Glass shards of various sizes.

Input: One of the aforementioned glass cups
Setting: 1:1
Output: One 500 millilitre glass cup. The walls of the cup are slightly thinner than the ones of the original one, resulting in the same mass.

Input: One of the aforementioned glass cups
Setting: Fine
Output: One precisely cut glass cup that refracts light in a manner that creates complex light patterns. The colour of these patterns is influenced by the drink in the glass. However, due to the point of convergence being within the cup the contents of the cup heat significantly faster when it is exposed to visible light. It holds the same amount of liquid as the original one (300 millilitres). The molecular lattice of the glass molecules is altered in a way that greatly increases the impact resistance of the cup.

Input: One of the aforementioned glass cups
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One shot glass, with the expected volume of 50ml. The shot glass has the same mass as the original cup - this property is caused by a great increase in the density of the original material. Through anomalous means, it is capable of holding up to 300ml of liquid before overflowing. This anomalous property only manifests if a beverage is used for filling the vessel. The glass has shown high resistance to pressure, impact and heat.

Addendum: It was later discovered that beverages containing ethanol slowly begin to degrade the ethanol into methanol, making the beverage toxic. This process begins immediately after 55 millilitres of beverage is poured into the shot glass. The speed of the reaction depends on alcohol content in the beverage, with beverages containing a higher percentage of alcohol degrading faster. Beverages containing 40% alcohol completely degraded after approximately 2 hours, while those containing only 12% alcohol fully degraded after more than 9 hours. This effect is believed to be a consequence of the cup's anomalous property. It is speculated that the excess liquid is contained within a small pocket dimension, where physical and chemical constants are slightly different, causing ethanol to be able to decompose itself into methanol. Placed in anomalous storage.

Test 914-1753
Name: Intern Lyfeld
Date: 06/12/2020
Total Items: Five Four scrubbing mitts

Note: After reading most of the test logs about this, I feel like I might be ready for getting something out from this after two weeks of working here. - Intern Lyfeld

Input: One of the above
Setting: Rough
Output: Nothing Various nylon strings, thin and spread out enough to make them difficult to perceive. Otherwise, they do not display anomalous effects.

Input: One of the above
Setting: Coarse
Output: Same as input A broken scrubbing mitt A mitt that perpetually unravels itself through anomalous means. Cannot be sewn back together, as the unraveling will start immediately after.

Input: One of the above
Setting: 1:1
Output: A nylon sock of a different brand. Aforementioned brand does not make socks. Weight is consistent with the other results, and displays no anomalous properties.

Input: One of the above
Setting: Fine
Output: A nylon glove, capable of absorbing any liquids upon contact. It is deemed unable to absorb liquids when those are protected by other materials. Despite that, it has been observed that it can reduce environmental moisture. Having its absorption capabilities tested, incineration of this anomalous item has been requested due to possible environmental hazards.

Note: I don't want to test my or anyone else's luck by putting this into someone's mouth, nor I think going Very Fine will be a wise decision as of now. I'll let the others risk themselves for science for now. - Intern Lyfeld

Test 914-1754
Name: Dr. Ignam
Date: 09/12/2020
Total Items: Three Four printed photographs depicting various celestial objects and phenomena. All printed in full color on letter sized pieces of white paper.

Input: One long-exposure photograph taken on 17/11/2015 of the 2015 Leonids. Exposure time of approximately one hour.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One slightly crumpled piece of paper with drawing on both sides. One side of the paper depicts a poorly drawn feline with the word “kity” [sic] written below the creature, all drawn with what appears to be orange crayon. The other side of the paper is covered in what are rather many failed attempts at legible writing, or random scribbles. One phrase is slightly legible on this side, which reads “4 yers od” [sic]. The scribbles on this side of the paper are drawn in various colors of what also appears to be crayon, with black and blue scribbles being noticeably abundant. The aforementioned phrase is notably the only thing drawn in pink.

Note: Although everything on this paper appears to be drawn with crayons, further examination has shown that the drawings are composed of the same printer ink used to print the original picture. The handwriting of the words is fairly consistent with that of a 4 year-old’s. I’ll hang this one on the break room fridge. - Dr. Ignam

Input: One photograph taken on an unknown date of a segment of the constellation Ursa Major, centered on the Big Dipper
Setting: Fine
Output: One photograph similar to the input photograph, but with most of the celestial bodies in the original photograph arranged in a different manner, seemingly randomly. Upon further inspection, the photograph is consistent with predictions of how the ''Big Dipper'' and other notable celestial bodies present in the photograph will appear when viewed from Earth in approximately [REDACTED] years.

Input: One photograph taken on 21/08/2017 of the solar eclipse that occurred on said date during totality.
Setting: Fine
Output: A small, non-anomalous pile of ashes, the amount that would be expected from burning a piece of paper

Note: The outcome of this test was rather unexpected, considering the results of the last two. Requesting approval from Dr. Veritas to retest the same photograph with a different setting. - Dr. Ignam

Note: Approved. - Veritas

Input: Same as previous input
Setting: Very Fine
Outcome: 6 photographs, all one-sixth of the size of the original photograph, depicting a series of [DATA EXPUNGED]. Date(s) unknown. Incinerated by request of O5-██.

Test 914-1755
Name: J.R. Regal
Date: 09/12/2020
Total Items: Five pieces of paper with partially erased code written in them.

Note: For this test, I took a simple code that generates empty test formats, erased most of it, and divided the paper into five sections, each of which will be handled by a different D-class with a different idea of how many pieces there are and what they contained. It is possible that we will be able to see how 914 interacts with conflicting information and if it is able to use stored data to determine the correct configuration and purpose.
They will be told that their paper contained an infinite loop printing "Fine" on each cycle, one-twentieth of code made to analyze grammatical errors, a fifth of a generator of empty 914 test formats, and a segment of a predictive algorithm for 914 tests. - J.R. Regal

Input: One piece of paper
Setting: Fine
Output: Fine fine fine fine One piece of paper, containing a cognitohazard that causes affected individuals to replace their vocabulary with "fine". Effect ceases once the output is no longer in contact with the affected individual

Input: One piece of paper
Setting: Fine
Output: One piece of paper with half a drawing signed by J.R. Kai One grey piece of paper with a cognitohazard that causes the viewer to see half a drawing signed by J.R. Kai.

Input: One piece of paper
Setting: Fine
Output: One piece of paper with a complete format generator code.

Input:
Setting:
Output:

Addendum:

Note: The fourth output appears to have retroactively erased all test logs information written after it leaving only the format and notes, which means the fifth test is lost. This test proves that SCP-914 is indeed capable of making connections between information obtained from the inputs of the prior tests and using it to filter incorrect or misleading information. I expect the effect to subside within a day since the output has been incinerated, and I shall now apply for leave before someone has me terminated for erasing the rest of the entire day's tests. - J.R. Regal

Note: Rosen backs up the test every few hours to protect the logs from idiots vandalising it. So you're fine. Well, you're not, but you're not in trouble. - Veritas

Test 914-1756
Name: Junior Researcher Boneka
Date: 15/12/2020
Total Items: Five signs reading “Caution: Wet Floor”

Input: One wet floor sign
Setting: 1:1
Output: One sign reading “Caution: Burning Floor”.

Input: One wet floor sign
Setting: Fine
Output: One sign reading “Caution: Wet Ceiling” that anomalously adheres to any ceiling.

Input: One wet floor sign
Setting: Fine
Output: One wet floor sign that, when placed, anomalously causes water to materialize on the floor within a 3-meter radius of it One wet floor sign that, when placed, exhibits a cognitohazard that compels all viewers to believe that the floor around it is covered in water and go out of their way to avoid it.

Input: One wet floor sign
Setting: Fine
Output: One sign reading “Caution: The floor will be wet”.

Addendum: Shortly after being placed in Research Cell 109-A, the water cooler in the break room started leaking, emptying its contents onto the floor. Further research suggests that whenever the output is placed on the ground, a water leakage or spill will occur somewhere nearby within the span of a few hours.

Input: One wet floor sign
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One visually unaltered wet floor sign.

Addendum: When the assigned D-Class personnel placed the output on the floor of Research Cell 109-A, he abruptly experienced rapid desiccation in which all the moisture in his body was drawn out and distributed evenly on the ground within a 3-meter radius of the sign. Remains and output incinerated.

Total Items: One CD of Frank Sinatra’s version of the song “Let It Snow”

Input: One CD of Frank Sinatra’s version of the song “Let It Snow”
Setting: 1:1
Output: One CD crudely labeled “le tits now [sic]”. Contains an hour-long audio documentary of a monotone male voice describing various medical disorders that affect the mammary glands.

Note: I’m not sure if it’s because of a cognitohazard or just my own paranoia, but I feel highly compelled to go in for my annual checkup a little early this year. - JR Boneka

Test 914-1759
Name: Intern Lyfeld
Date: 25/12/2020
Total Items: Two CDs, labeled "Folklore Christmas Songs".

Note: I'm incredibly tired of hearing Mariah Carey here around, so, I beg of you, please, give me something that isn't her. - Intern Lyfeld

Input: One of the CDs mentioned above
Setting: 1:1
Output: A DVD titled "All I want for Christmas is Folklore", by Mariah Carey. Songs seem to not have any anomaly whatsoever, and are perfectly performed by its singer.

Test 914-1760
Name: Researcher Zita Ni
Date: 25/12/2020
Total Items: One CD containing the Stranger Under My Skin EP by Eason Chan

Note: Christmas usually has a pleasant connotation, but what if the Christmas song used is more melancholy? - R. Zita

Input: Above CD
Setting: Fine
Output: A DVD containing the nine songs in the EP played in reverse order. However, when "My Private Christmas Song" is played, the voice instead corresponds to the person closest to the DVD player, and is sang in the person's native language.

Note: Interestingly, all songs on the EP had a more upbeat style than the original. "Snow in June" in particular sounded quite unnatural considering its depressing lyrical content. - R. Zita

Note: Christmas songs are even worse in Dutch. - Veritas

Test 914-1761
Name: Intern Francois Beauvillier
Date: 25/12/2020
Total Items: One CD of "364 Days", by the rock band The Murder City Devils.

Input: The aforementioned CD.
Setting: Fine
Output: The inputted CD.

Note: Weird. Absolutely nothing changed. That's extremely unusual. - Intern Beauvillier

Addendum: Subsequent testing has shown that listening to this CD will induce in the listener a dislke for all things related to Christmas proportional to the attachment they have for the Christmas holidays. It has no effect on people who already dislike Christmas.

Test 914-1762
Name: Weapons Researcher Sam Szymons
Date: 25/12/2020
Total Items: One CD containing a .mp3 file of “It’s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year” by Andy Williams

Test 914-1765
Name: Dr. N Rose
Date: 27/12/2020
Total Items: Three bottles each of Ritalin, Zoloft, Risperdal and Codeine

Input: One of the aforementioned bottles of Ritalin
Setting: 1:1
Output: One bottle of Adderall medication

Input: One of the aforementioned bottles of Ritalin
Setting: Fine
Output: One bottle of pills. The bottle has a sticker indicating it as a medication to treat Attention Deficit Disorder. Upon consumption, the subject will become increasingly lethargic and their mental state deteriorates, eventually becoming a form of depression. The subject will refuse to perform any task it must perform manually, and eventually autonomously. After a period of four hours, the subject will cease respiration and suffocate unless action is taken.

Note: There is currently one surviving D-Class in a coma. They will be examined carefully until all possible information is gathered. - Dr. Rose

Input: One of the aforementioned bottles of Zoloft
Setting: 1:1
Output: A bottle of Prozac medication.

Input: One of the aforementioned bottles of Zoloft
Setting: Fine
Output: A bottle of white powder. There are no labels to discern any intent of the powder. Subjects who ingested the powder began acting in a similar manner to those abusing cocaine. After twenty-three minutes, the subject will begin bleeding from all cranial orifices. Despite medical intervention, the bleeding continues until the subject expires in a varied time between thirty minutes and three hours.

Input: One of the aforementioned bottles of Risperdal
Setting: 1:1
Output: A bottle of pills that, when consumed, have the subject placed in a drug-induced psychosis. D-Class was sedated after attempting to attack personnel; effects wore off after an hour.

Input: One of the aforementioned bottles of Risperdal
Setting: Fine
Output: A bottle of pills in similar design to standard red-white antibiotics. The bottle’s label indicates them as a drug to enhance creative freedoms. Subjects who take the drug experience schizophrenic symptoms in line with disembodied voices. The subject will become increasingly paranoid and incomprehensible, but will show an increased aptitude for a style of art they were previously proficient in. The effects cease after a period of fourty-six minutes, with the subject having no recollection of the events.

Input: One of the aforementioned bottles of Codeine
Setting: 1:1
Output: An unnamed bottle of pills. When taken, the subject will experience full-body pain, despite there being no physical signs of pain in any case. The effects cease after 6 minutes and thirteen seconds. The pain has been described as extreme burning and being stabbed or shot.

Input: One of the aforementioned bottles of Codeine
Setting: Fine
Output: A bottle of green pills. When taken, the subject will enter a stage where they will feel no pain of any kind, despite taking serious injuries or wounds. After fifty-two minutes, the subject will lose their remaining senses one by one at random. After this, the subject will collapse and begin screaming hysterically, complaining of extreme pain all across the body. Within five minutes, the subject expires, though the cause is unclear.

Note: I’ve done everything in the autopsies to try and locate the cause. Nothing comes through with enough evidence to determine it. At first, we believed it to be a cardiac-related issue, however there are no signs of palpitations or damage to the heart that were not previously recorded in the D-Class’ medical files. - Dr. Rose

Input: The remaining bottle of each drug
Setting: Fine
Output: An unnamed bottle of red and blue pills. The effects are similar to that of SCP-500, however they are much stronger, and result in the taker becoming an obsessive hypochondriac. The subject will also begin suffering from severe overdosing symptoms akin to those of illicit substance abuse. The subject expires within one hour of ingesting the pill, and autopsy results reveal the subject to be in perfect health medically. No cause of death can be determined.

Note: All of the outputs are contained in a locked cabinet in Anomalous Storage to allow for additional screening and analysis, and because we don’t know if they will affect the incinerator in any way. Better safe than sorry. If you need medication for any reason, just come down to the medical wing; we don’t bite. - Dr. Rose

Note: Rose, I've read your report. Despite producing results, I'm hereby formally reminding you that D-Class personnel do not, in fact, grow on trees. Please see me in my office at the earliest convenience so we can have a talk on resource management and a personal evaluation. - Veritas

Name: Researcher Carson
Date: 27/12/2020
Total Items: Three 12th Grade textbooks on world history, brought from a library in New York City, New York, USA.

Input: One history textbook
Setting: 1:1
Output: One 12th grade mathematics textbook, identical to those from a library in Portland, Oregon, USA.

Input: One history textbook
Setting: Fine
Output: One hardcover book with exterior dimensions identical to that of the original textbook. The book appears to be 835 pages long has an indeterminate number of pages that each viewer interprets differently, and the interior of the book appears to contain biographic details on Researcher Carson has been proved to be blank upon advanced testing, but contains a memetic effect that affects any individual viewing the book's interior to contain biographic details of the said individual, written in their native language.

Input: One history textbook
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One origami figure of an unidentified middle-aged man. When any question concerning a future event is asked within its audible range, the figure will respond with a prediction in the same language as the question asked. Upon further testing, the predictions have be determined to be approximately 63% 49% 31% accurate the predictions' accuracy appear to decrease over time. Upon the 927th question being asked, the figure spontaneously collapsed into dark grey ashes, which have been determined to be non-anomalous paper ashes upon analysis.

Test 914-1767
Name: Doctor Jakob Reigen
Date: 03/01/2021
Total Items: Four 250mL vials, each containing 100mL of siphoned Elan-Vital Energy (EVE). Measurements of siphoned EVE report minimal intensity levels with no observable Aspect Radiation being detected. Siphoned EVE extracted from Taraxacum (Dandelion flowers).

Input: One vial of siphoned EVE
Setting: 1:1
Output: A visually unchanged vial containing the aforementioned 100mL of siphoned EVE. Analysis of the vial determined that, despite no change in intensity, measured EVE displayed significant fluctuations from previous aura signatures.

Input: One vial of siphoned EVE
Setting: Fine
Output: A visually unchanged vial containing the aforementioned 100mL of siphoned EVE. Increased intensity from previous measurements detected. Minor Aspect Radiation was also observed, but insufficient for reality warping to occur.

Note: That's… not right. - Dr. Reigen

Input: One vial of siphoned EVE
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A visually unchanged vial containing the aforementioned 100mL of siphoned EVE. Significantly increased intensity from previous measurements detected. Aspect Radiation was also observed, with minimally destructive reality warping phenomena occurring around the immediate vicinity of the vial itself. Object transferred to Site-119's Thaumatology Department for further investigation.

Note: Wow. SCP-914 is concentrating the EVE inside each vial after every conversion without changing the total quantity. But how? It should be decreasing. This possibly means that: 1) SCP-914 possesses living energy and/or sapience and 2) it's adding this energy onto other objects to compensate. - Dr. Reigen

Input: Final vial of siphoned EVE
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A visually unchanged vial containing 100mL of concentrated lemon-lime soda. No measurements of EVE or Aspect Radiation detected.

Note: Or not. - Dr. Reigen

Note: It likes to do that. - Senior Researcher Pines.

Test 914-1768
Name: Dr. N Rose
Date: 04/01/2021
Total Items: Two bottle each of following substance: Morphine, Saline Solution and Ibuprofen Oral Fluid

Happy New Year, everyone! Hope you all are happy to leave behind the travesty of 2020. Now, onto business; once again, I’m using medications, but this time it will be isolated to liquids. - Dr. Rose

Input: One bottle of Morphine
Setting: Fine
Output: One bottle of a thick, yellow liquid. The label describes it as a painkiller medication, by use of transferring pain to another person. It is unclear how this process is possible. During testing, two D-Class were subject to an injection of 25ml of the liquid. As one was subjected to a series of controlled electric shocks, the other D-Class screamed in pain. The aforementioned subject later described feeling electrocuted, with the first being otherwise unaffected, despite receiving electrical burns to the hands. The effects of the dosage ceased after thirty-seven minutes, but is theorised to be relevant to the dosage amount.

Input: One bottle of Saline Solution
Setting: Fine
Output: Five bottles of a clear liquid, with equivalent mass to the input, and a paper note. The note reads ”Read well and listen close, for ye risk life with this choice. One elixir you face could save you of all ailments, while all its friends will lead to a grave. Choose well, and be awakened. Choose poorly, and be slain.”. Chemical analysis of all liquids showed no differences. Testing cancelled, and the bottles and note stored in Anomalous Storage.

I’m not exactly in the mood for a fatality, especially with only a one in five chance to live. - Dr. Rose

Input: One bottle of Ibuprofen Oral Fluid
Setting: Fine
Output: A pile of brown, translucent pills. Chemical analysis revealed them to contain traces of paper and glass. Testing resulted in a D-Class ingesting a single pill, and describing an absence of pain, sense of heat and a quieter stomach. After fourteen minutes, the D-Class collapsed, complaining of severe stomach pains and began to cough blood. Testing with the D-Class’ medical state is ongoing, though they have since recovered. All the pills placed in a secure container and isolated in Anomalous Storage.

Input: The remaining bottles of each drug
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A large bottle of a thick black sludge with a texture akin to tar, and is extremely pungent. Testing with the liquid reveals it to be extremely painful, with the subject D-Class reporting searing pain. This pain would be felt all across the body after injection for nine minutes. After the time period elapsed, the D-Class was found to have an improved status of health, that has yet to waver. The D-Class also has an increased level of pride and recklessness, and has been detained in a secure Human Containment Cell.

Note: If we could isolate the medical properties of this output, we could theoretically have an army of super-soldiers. That being said, however, any further testing of this liquid is better not performed with humans again, until we are sure of its full capabilities. - Dr. Rose

Note: Rose, are you familiar with the concept of something ''falling in the wrong hands''? It's going into storage, no less than O5 is deciding on this one. There's not much of it, and we can't replicate it because 914 does nothing twice, as far as we observed anyway. - Veritas

Input: One novelty singing fish
Setting: Fine
Output: One visually identical novelty singing fish. When it is activated, it exhibits an auditory cognitohazard that compels all those who hear it to stick themselves to a wall and sing along loudly until the song is over, at which point the cognitohazard ceases.

Note: That’s three minutes of my life I’m never getting back. Can we delete that security footage? - JR Boneka

Input: One novelty singing fish
Setting: Fine
Output: One animate novelty singing fish that vocalizes profanities and personal insults towards anybody that approaches it. During testing and transport between different areas in the facility, the output was exposed to various personnel. A brief list of how it responded to the individuals it encountered is included below.

Personnel	Vocalization
D-639274	“I bet you had a lot of fun scamming all those families out of their life savings! Well look where you are now, asswipe! Was it worth it to you? I have more dignity than you and I'm a fucking singing fish!”
D-937262	“Look at me, I’m [D-937262’S FORMER NAME REDACTED]! I’m going to murder my wife and children so I can get my filthy little hands on that sweet sweet life insurance, and I’m obviously such a genius that I’m going to get away with it! Well, look at where that got you, you fucking jackass!”
JR Boneka	“Oh look, it's Boneka, the pinkest most cutesy thing that somehow found her way into the Foundation! I don't know what's worse, your incompetence, the fact that I feel like snorting pink glitter when you get near, or that singing from earlier!”
Dr. Veritas	The output paused its insults to cheerily sing “Happy Birthday to You” before resuming and calling him a “neurotic, sadistic tyrant that probably failed [his] anger management course”. Following this, fish's head exploded.

Total Items: One DVD-Rom containing the video game ''The Sims 3''

Input: One DVD-Rom containing the video game ''The Sims 3''
Setting: 1:1
Output: One DVD-Rom containing the video game ''The Sims 3'' but all the default ''Sims'' representations of employees at the 19-23 facility. By starting the game, a character can be created, who will become researcher working under Dr. Veritas and Dr. Hackett. Various other researchers from the facility can also be interacted with.

Input: Tested object above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A heavily modded version of the output above. Other researchers can be commanded to take various actions (canceling their current actions, walking somewhere or sitting down). Testing reveals that these commands affect the represented researcher in real life. Controlling a ''Sim'' for too long will result in the effect ceasing, going around 5 minutes. Trying to control Dr. Veritas will result in crashing the game.

Note: Can whoever keeps playing this stop canceling my actions? - J.R. Evangeline

Test 914-1772

Input: One war hammer replica
Setting: Rough
Output: A puddle of melted steel

Input: One war hammer replica
Setting: Coarse
Output: The same hammer, but dented and scratched in many areas. The hammer is also considerably rusted.

Input: One war hammer replica
Setting: 1:1
Output: One replica of a medieval longsword

Input: One war hammer replica
Setting: Fine
Output: A seemingly unaltered war hammer replica. The war hammer is anomalously lightweight for its size and the material it was made from. It also deformed upon usage, rendering it unusable.

Input: One war hammer replica
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A hammer resembling the war hammer prop used by the band Gloryhammer during live performances. When held, the person in question performs a song composed by the band Gloryhammer at random. Further testing reveals that no improvement is made on the subjects' singing capability or sense of rhythm.

Test 914-1774
Name: Junior Researcher Shion
Date: 21/01/2020
Total Items: One plastic model of a spear, one plastic model of a shield

Input: One model spear
Setting: Fine
Output: One model spear, with an ornate clockwork design decorating the spearhead. When the spear tip is placed against any surface, an incision is anomalously created on the surface. An imprint on the spear handle reads "914 Brand Spear - Pierces any Shield!"

Input: One model shield
Setting: Fine
Output: One model shield, with an ornate clockwork design matching that of the previous output. The shield is impervious to incision or laceration from any sharp edges. An imprint on the back of the shield reads "914 Brand Shield - Defends Against any Spear!"

Addendum: Bringing the outputs within 5 meters of one another causes a cognitohazardous effect to manifest, compelling observers to attempt to impale the shield with the spear. D-Class retrieving the output was restrained after attempting to do so. Both outputs placed in Anomalous Storage, permission to cross-test outputs requested denied, for the sake of personnel safety.

Test 914-1775
Name: Weapons Researcher Sam Szymons
Date: 22/01/2021
Total Items: One Logitech G512 keyboard

Input: Aforementioned keyboard
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A visually unchanged keyboard, except for the logo on the shell being replaced with a logo of a gear. Anomalous effects were observed immediately when a key was pressed. The outputted keyboard appears to manifest certain anomalous actions in the real world. Notable functions documented in the table below.

Key(s) Pressed	Corresponding Occurrence
Ctrl+F	Any object or person specified using the numerical and letter keys will be "highlighted". This is signified by a blueish aura floating around the "highlighted object"
Ctrl+X	Any "selected" object or person will immediately demanifest. Later it was found the affected individuals were sent to the "clipboard" (The bulletin board in the Break Room), a corresponding pencil drawing on a post-it note resembling the affected object/person would manifest on the "clipboard." The only way to remanifest those affected is to press "Ctrl+V"
Ctrl+Alt+Escape	Opens a "Task Manager", a visual apparition appearing approximately a meter above the user's face, similar in appearance to the same application used on Windows computers. Any actions attempted with the generated "Task Manager" by any non-administrative personnel seems to fail, it is presumed that only Dr. Veritas could use this feature.
Ctrl+H	Causes a "selected" object or person to become "Transparent", being unable to be viewed by other people or cameras. This effect can be reversed by pressing the key combination again.
Addendum: The output lost function after its internal battery ran out. Replacing the battery did not cause the anomalous effect to remanifest.

Test 914-1776
Name: Junior Researcher Boyett
Date: 01/02/2021
Total Items: Three balance scales, each loaded with two 1 kilogram stainless steel cylinder standards, one on either end of the scale
Suggested Note: Each standard was calibrated by comparison to an original kilogram mass standard in a pressure sealed chamber, and are accurate to within a billionth of the standard

Input: One balance scale and weights
Setting: 1:1
Output: Scale with two 500 gram weights, of exact same design as the original weights, on either end. Scale noted to be painted blue instead of green, but otherwise identical to input.

Input: One balance scale and weights
Setting: Fine
Output: One scale that upon initial opening appeared unchanged, but upon closer examination appeared to have many smaller more precise marks as small as 1 nanometer. Weights were smaller, and had a density identical to the platinum-iridium alloy used in the international prototype kilogram. Spectroscopy tests show the same composition as the original steel cylinders.

Input: One balance scale and weights
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One unchanged balance scale, tilted heavily towards the left side. Both cylinders were identical in appearance. The left cylinder appeared extremely heavy based on the scale, but as soon as a D-class personnel reached to pick it up, the cylinder flew as if struck with large amounts of force. It immediately fell, with tests later confirming it to fall at roughly 2g of acceleration. Despite this, the cylinder reacted as though much larger forces were applied, even in extremely small shock load tests. The right cylinder was entirely unaffected by gravity, if left undisturbed it begins to float and tilt due to earth’s rotation, but requires much more force to move relative to a normal cylinder.

Test 914-1777
Name: Researcher H. Franklin, assisted by anomalous computer expert ██████ ████.
Date: 08/02/2021
Total Items: One Game Genie device, one copy of Tetris, one copy of Loopz, one Light Zapper controller, one standard controller, all for the Nintendo Entertainment System

Note: I had a couple of these sitting around that my dad had. After finding out they wouldn't sell for anything on eBay, I found better use for them here. I was also assigned an actual computer scientist to help me. - H. Franklin

Input: One Game Genie device
Setting: Fine
Output: An externally identical device. However, when used in the same way as a non-anomalous counterpart, the header text reads "I WISH…" and the keyboard can be used to write a request in English which the game will mirror. The device uses exact wording to create undesirable versions of these requests, similar to a stereotypical genie. Such as if "MARIO DIDN'T DIE" is entered in Super Mario Bros, the resulting game will simply replace both players with the Luigi character. The internals of the device seem to be a highly advanced AI to read the input text and an unidentified board that performs the usual functions of the device, as controlled by said AI.

Input: One Nintendo Entertainment System copy of Loopz
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A complex array of electrical components, made of the same materials as the input. Despite no clear power source, touching the device with bare skin will cause it to shock and burn the person doing so. After this, they experience neurological alterations akin to severe OCD, causing them to arrange objects so that they create a circle. There is no known way to reverse the effects, but they can be managed in the same way as mundane OCD tendencies.

Input: One Nintendo Entertainment System copy of Tetris
Setting: Fine
Output: An otherwise identical cartridge with a white label reading "eBay" with the same colors as those on www.ebay.com, but with a 1980s font. Placing the device in a fitting console will load a game which acts as a primitive interface with the site, somehow updated despite no clear internet connection. Internal examination reveals an incoherent mass of plastic and metal.

Note: SCP-914 seems to have been influenced by the fact that input was intended to be sold on eBay. - Dr. ██████ ████

Input: One Nintendo Entertainment System controller
Setting: 1:1
Output: A similar device, with the exception of a third button labeled "C" next to the first two. Pressing this sends a signal to pressing the down and A button at the same time.

Input: One Nintendo Entertainment System Zapper Light Gun controller
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small orange and grey robot resembling Dynastes hercules, or a Hercules Beetle. The robot will attempt to grab any gun within visual range and grip the trigger with its legs. As of yet it has never successfully fired one by doing so, but it is contained with active-item security to prevent it from reaching a firearm outside of testing.

Test 914-1778
Name: Researcher MacLean, Junior Researcher Boneka
Date: 10/02/2021
Total Items: Three penny press machines

Input: One penny press machine
Setting: Fine
Output: One “pressed penny presser”. Inserting a pressed penny will result in it being compressed into a thin, featureless disc, then dispensed.

Input: One penny press machine
Setting: Fine
Output: One coin press machine that accepts the coin of lowest value from any existing currency. The coin is printed with an image of a landmark from the region where the currency is used. For example, inputting a Japanese 1-yen coin yields a print of Mount Fuji, inputting a British 1-pence coin yields a print of the Big Ben tower, and inputting an Indonesian 25-rupiah coin yields a print of Borobudur. Inputting a 1-cent euro coin will yield a landmark from a random nation in the European Union.

Input: One penny press machine
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A modified penny press machine with a chute instead of a slot. Inserting any material into the chute will result in the machine dispensing multiple “pressed penny” shaped objects made out of the material, compressed to an extent that would not be possible under normal circumstances.

Input	Output
One mandarin orange	Discs composed mostly of the orange's compressed peel, noted to be very sticky with juice.
0.5 kg of sand	Discs of sandstones, compacted enough that they do not crumble apart just from being handled.
2 kg of peat	Discs of lignite coal
A piece of carbon	N/A
Addendum: When attempting to wind the machine after inserting the piece of carbon, it became jammed. Attempts to repair it are currently ongoing.

Note: I was trying to see if I could get it to create diamonds. I should've known it wasn't going to be that easy. - JR Boneka

Test 914-1779
Name: Junior Researcher Arcadia
Date: 20/02/2021
Total Items: Three plastic mouth guards

Input: One mouth guard
Setting: Coarse
Output: One mouth guard with sizeable holes in it.

Input: One mouth guard
Setting: 1:1
Output: One retainer, seemingly ineffective at retaining teeth.

Input: One mouth guard
Setting: Fine
Output: One bluish green mouth guard with an inscription reading, "For fresher breath."
Testing has revealed that inserting the mouth guard inside of a person's mouth kills
approximately 99.9% of all bacteria present around the tongue and teeth areas. Using the output seemingly lowers the immune response to mouth infections, and gum disease.

Note: Class-D personnel stated that it tastes like spearmint. - Junior Researcher Arcadia

Name: Dr. Transom
Date: 25/02/2021
Total Items: One thumb drive containing a CSS stylesheet retrieved from twitter.com

Input: The thumb drive
Setting: Fine
Output: One thumb drive containing an executable program. When installed onto a computer and run, it displays an interface resembling the layout of a Twitter account page, although initially there are no posts displayed. Clicking the button that would usually be used to write a post will instead generate one automatically, the content of which is a "callout post" about whoever is using the computer when the post is generated, detailing an extensive list of "problematic" things that the user has done in the past. Despite being framed as severe crimes, the actions of which the user is accused of seem to be mundane or mildly offensive at most. A brief list of users and generated posts is included below.

Name	Post
D-194725	"hey yall pls block user @/D-194/725 she's actually a huge anti-environmentalist. i dont have any screens but i used to be in first grade with her and she threw a big tantrum when the teacher asked her to participate during clean-up time so ik she doesn't care about trying to clean up the planet either"
JR Boneka	"ik most of u guys like this user for her art so dont fuckin white knight at me ill block u xoxo anyway @/b/one/ka is a total art elitist bc on this forexposure post from a few years ago she said u shouldnt trace other ppls work and claim it as ur own which is oppressive for people who cant draw on their own. art should be for everybody and shes a bigot for saying artists have a right to not want other people to trace or edit their shit also i think her commission prices are too high like omfg ur """art""" is not worth that fucking much sweetie get off ur high horse LMAOOOO"
Researcher MacLean	"omg ok so there's fucking jackass i know (user @/m/acl/ean) and he's an entitled piece of shit, he ALWAYS takes the last donut at company parties like dude has it never occurred to you that there are starving children out there or is your stomach so big that your brain had to downsize in order to compensate. he just has such rancid douche vibes if u like him we cant be friends sorry uwu"
Dr. Veritas	"i dont like bosses to begin with bc theyre always bastards but i especially hate @/ve/ritas bc hes so fucking nitpicky about making sure that his employees write their documents with decent grammar like yall know that some ppl literally CANT write well bc they have mental conditions right??? sorry im missing full stops or whatever idfc i dont need to be the next edgar allen fucking poe to write these posts yall get my point. tldr ableism cringe lol"
Dr. Transom	"after reviewing his funding for the previous year and cross-referencing them with other documents (more screens r in my caard) im p sure @/tr/a/nsom is fudging the numbers? im inclined 2 believe hes just straight up misappropriating cash idk what for tho. some1 found out about it a while ago and tried to make their own callout post already but when i went to go check they had already deactivated their acc? i might be going out on a limb here but i think he probably harassed them off the site to try and cover up the evidence. sus af"
Addendum: After viewing his result generated by the program, Dr. Transom became agitated and attempted to damage the computer. He was quickly apprehended and detained by site security. A thorough investigation reveals that Dr. Transom has been covertly embezzling Foundation funds for several years, and that he is linked to the previously unsolved murder of a coworker at one of his former assignments, likely due to the victim discovering his crimes. Termination request is currently processing.

Note: What I want to know is, why did even the convicted D-Class have really inconsequential things written in her callout post but that guy's had actual crimes? - JR Boneka

Test 914-1781
Name: Researcher Erin
Date: 08/03/2021
Total Items: Five wooden cups, five steel cups, five ceramic cups

Note: Just transferred here from Site 17. I'm hoping I'll be a help to the team! - R. Erin

Input: One wooden cup, one stainless steel cup, one ceramic cup
Setting: Rough
Output: Broken ceramic shards, pile of ashes, and one rusted iron cup.

Input: One wooden cup, one stainless steel cup, one ceramic cup
Setting: Coarse
Output: Pile of wood pulp, iron, cobalt, chromium, and various other elements sorted by weight, and a misshapen piece of unhardened clay.

Input: One wooden cup, one stainless steel cup, one ceramic cup
Setting: 1:1
Output: One small wooden bowl, one small stainless steel pan, and one light brick.

Input: One wooden cup, one stainless steel cup, one ceramic cup
Setting: Fine
Output: One very dense cup, created from the three previous cups. Tests on the cup revealed that the cup is evenly made up of the elements that make up wood, stainless steel, and ceramic. Upon testing to determine stability, the cup shattered into several pieces. All pieces were cleaned up and placed into storage.

Input: One wooden cup, one stainless steel cup, one ceramic cup
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One ceramic cup filled with a molten substance, which was revealed to be wood pulp melted in liquid steel. Upon sight of the cup, the viewer is immediately compelled to drink the liquid. Item was retrieved and disposed of.

Test 914-1782
Name: Junior Researcher Boneka
Date: 12/03/2021
Total Items: Three cans of Off! brand mosquito repellant spray

Input: One can of Off! brand mosquito repellant spray
Setting: 1:1
Output: One can of Off! brand spider repellant spray. This is not an existing product from the manufacturer.

Input: One can of Off! brand mosquito repellant spray
Setting: Fine
Output: An animate bat made of metal, with an insect spray contained inside its abdomen. The bat is typically passive, but if it detects a mosquito it will chase after and spray it, using a sprayer on the inside of its mouth.

Input: One can of Off! brand mosquito repellant spray
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One can of On! brand mosquito attractant spray

Incident Report: After all those overseeing the test were given protective clothing, D-017472 was instructed to spray himself with the output. Shortly after doing so, masses of mosquitoes began to swarm into the facility and clustered around D-017472, who died from blood loss within thirty seconds. After the D-Class expired, the mosquitoes began attempting to attack other personnel in the facility. Mosquitoes were eventually terminated via H2O-9000, the on-site sprinkler system, the Fine output produced prior to this one, and chemical bug spray, and a cleanup crew has been assigned to remove the dead insects and perform a thorough cleansing of the facility. Though several personnel have developed rashes due to mosquito bites, the only casualty was the assigned D-Class. All people on-site will be screened for malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases.

Note: You know what? This is it. This is the single most horrifying thing that I have experienced at this facility. Not the 8-ball spider thing. Not the fact that I was put in a coma for three days. Not that I witnessed as all the water was violently siphoned out of a D-class's body, turning him into a shriveled-up raisin. No, this is what's going to make my skin crawl for months. I overheard someone saying that there were mosquitoes pouring out of the drains in the sinks. And that D-Class… I could hear him scream, and then the screaming became drowned out as his mouth was filled with mosquitoes. I am so stupid. Why did I even for a single second think that it would be a good idea to test this output? It's literally what it said on the tin. Fucking mosquito attractant. It attracts mosquitoes. Didn't need a fucking rocket scientist to figure that one out. Nice going, Boneka. I think I'm going to have nightmares about this. - JR Boneka

Note: JR. Boneka has been scheduled for psychiatric evaluation at my request. Amnestic treatment is currently being considered has been performed by on-site psychiatrist Dr. Serrano and myself. JR Boneka has been informed about the reason behind this decision, but security recordings have been destroyed for the well-being of herself and other personnel. - Veritas

Input: One stepped caps lock keycap
Setting: Rough
Output: Shredded plastic

Input: One stepped caps lock keycap
Setting: Coarse
Output: One plain caps lock keycap

Input: One stepped caps lock keycap
Setting: 1:1
Output: Near-identical keycap, with only the print being replaced by the words "Hats Lock". Using it on a keyboard produces no anomalous effect.

Input: One stepped caps lock keycap
Setting: Fine
Output: Near-identical keycap, with only the print being replaced by the words "Cap Lock". Using it on a keyboard in place of the caps lock key prevents all other keycaps from detaching.

Input: One stepped caps lock keycap
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small plastic pill.

Note: Object has been transported to another site for safe testing. - Belopaku

Input: One plain caps lock keycap
Setting: Rough
Output: A thin irregular disk of plastic that appears to be a solidified puddle of molten plastic.

Input: One plain caps lock keycap
Setting: Coarse
Output: One menu key keycap

Input: One plain caps lock keycap
Setting: 1:1
Output: Near-identical keycap, with only the print being replaced by the words "Cups Lock". Using it on a keyboard produces no anomalous effect.

Input: One plain caps lock keycap
Setting: Fine
Output: A similar-sized keycap with the words "Caps Lock Undo" printed on the top. Closer inspection has revealed that it may cause some anomalous effect when used on a keyboard, but it appears to be unable to fit in any known make of keyboard.

Input: One plain caps lock keycap
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A thin plastic film, with the words "Locks Cap" printed on its surface. Upon touching the surface of any lock(the definition of "lock" appears to be arbitrary but reasonable), it will wrap itself around it, turning itself into a removable 'cap' for the lock. The object returns to its film state once removed.

Test 914-1784
Name: Dr. N Rose
Date: 20/03/2021
Total Items: One each of the following monitors: Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, Electrooculogram, Electroretinogram, Pulse Oximeter, Electromyogram

Input: One Electrocardiograph
Setting: 1:1
Output: An identical electrocardiogram. When activated, the device records the surrounding heart rate and electrical activity of the heart of every individual within a 15m radius. There are no indications as to who the heart rate may be monitoring at the time, unless an individual is either added or removed to the radius.

Note: While seemingly useful, this monitor is quite the opposite. There’s no way of telling whose heart rate is whose and there’s no way of seeing any irregularities since it ends up affecting all of the monitors. If someone had arrhythmia, for instance, the graph would show all individuals as having such. - Dr. Rose

Input: One Electroencephalograph
Setting: Fine
Output: An identical monitor. When connected to a subject patient, the monitor works as intended. After a period of 1 hour, the subject’s cranium begins expanding at a rate of 2mm per minute. There are no indications of pain or damage to the subject or their cranial condition. If the subject is removed, the subject will attempt to reattach the probes to their cranium, in a similar manner to an addict. Further testing cancelled after a D-Class damaged the output by forcibly removing the electrodes.

Note: Attempting to replace the electrodes just resulted in electrical damage. The D-Class has been restrained and is currently in an isolated cell. - Dr. Rose

Input: One Electrooculogram
Setting: Fine
Output: An identical monitor. When active, the monitor records all current vision of whoever is connected to the machine. The subject connected to the monitor feels no sensation of any pain, and instead can function normally. However, all dials and buttons on the monitor change an aspect of the eyes, despite their labeling; dials to regulate the rate of electric activity instead change the colour of the subject’s iris. This leads to the subject’s vision becoming tinged to the selected colour.

Input: One Electroretinogram
Setting: Fine
Output: Testing Cancelled. ERG was found to be non-functioning and had sustained damage to the cords. Dr. Rose removed the ERG from the testing site for safety reasons.

Input: One Pulse Oximeter
Setting: Fine
Output: A near identical Oximeter. The labels on both the monitor and the laser device have been replaced with the logo of Are We Cool Yet? When in use, the subject connected reported excruciating pain across the body. The monitor readings reported toxicity of the blood was at maximum levels. After three minutes, the subject suffered anomalous hemorrhaging of all internal organs. D-Class died by exsanguination after a period of seven minutes and nineteen seconds.

Note: As far as we’re aware, this isn’t an item among AWCY?’s collections. Further investigation may be required. - Dr. Rose

Input: One Electromyograph
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A monitor in similar style to the input. To the monitor, a multitude of varying cords have been added, each with their own purposes. When active, the monitor acts with the ability of all previous inputs. When an individual with a minor medical ailment is connected to the device, the individual anomalously becomes subject to an extreme method of treatment. The following table details some examples.

Name:	Ailment Prior to Connection:	Treatment:
D- 47102	Pneumonia	Was subject to a successful lung transplant.
D-38123	Rash on the elbows as a result of Eczema	Was subject to skin grafts on the affected areas. The skin was repurposed from the thighs.
D-93527	Subject has been noting feelings of Dysphoria before being connected. Medical records confirm subject was infertile	Underwent a sex change that anonamously also resulted in the D-Class regaining fertility. D-Class was a biological male before treatment.
D-10666	Suffered several minor cuts to the hands and arms after an altercation with another D-Class	Both arms amputated after D-Class complained over having no sense of feeling in their left hand. This was previously noted as a symptom of a spinal surgery prior to joining the Foundation.
D-42099	Complained of lack of sleep due to stress. Insomnia diagnosis pending.	Subject immediately ceased all vital functions and died. 8 hours after connection, the subject anomalously resumed vital functions, but remains comatose. Hormonal balance was completely typical.
Note: Well, he's not stressed anymore. - Dr. Norton

Note: He's a vegetable. - Dr. Rose

Test 914-1785
Name: Researcher Connolly
Date: 26/03/2021
Total Items: Five slips of paper, each one having a different Latin expression written on it; five blank stone slabs measuring 50cm x 2.5cm x 50cm.

Input: One stone slab, one slip of paper with “Fiat justitia, ruat caelum” (Translation: Let justice be done, though the heavens fall) written on it
Setting: Fine
Output: The same slip of paper, nearly folded in two. One stone slab, with the top rounded off in the style of a tombstone. Etched on the slab is the Lord’s Prayer and an inscription reading: “RIP Justice - Forever in Our Eyes”.

Input: One stone slab, one slip of paper with “Audentes fortuna iuvat” (Fortune favours the bold) written on it
Setting: Fine
Output: A pile of ash, and the same stone slab. Etched on the slab is the phrase “Et mites autem haereditate possidebunt terram”. This phrase translates to “And the meek shall inherit the Earth.”

Input: One stone slab, one slip of paper with “Ecce homo” (Behold the man) written on it
Setting: Fine
Output: The same note, unchanged, and the same stone slab. Etched into the slab is a relief of a human face in lifelike detail. Who the slab is depicting is yet unknown, as all facial recognition databases indexed have yet to detect a match on any person.

Input: One stone slab, one slip of paper with “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?” (Who will guard the guards?) written on it
Setting: Fine
Output: The same slip of paper, folded into the shape of a cross, and the same stone slab. Etched into the slab is the logo of the Foundation.

Input: One stone slab, one slip of paper with “Dulce et decorum est, pro patria mori” (It is sweet and honourable to die for one’s country) written on it
Setting: Fine
Output: The same slip of paper, precisely cut into the shape of a poppy. The stone slab, precisely cut into a sword and shield. Produces a slightly memetic effect causing those who view the sword and shield to become increasingly hostile towards people of other nationalities they deemed “enemies”.

Note: We have a lot of different nationalities here. Item incinerated before anyone decides to shoot another Archduke. - Researcher Connolly

Test 914-1786
Name: Intern Francois Beauvillier
Date: 29/03/2021
Total Items: The board games Monopoly, Diplomacy, Battleship, and a game of chess

Input: The Monopoly board game
Setting: Fine
Output: A visibly unchanged Monopoly board game. All in-game transactions between players are also reflected in real life, with money transfers between the players' bank accounts. Should a player's bank account be empty, he will be unable to pick any die before replenishing his account.

Input: The Diplomacy board game
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A visibly unchanged Diplomacy board game. However, when players get their country assigned, their personality will change to reflect that of the leader of said country in 1914. Effect lasts until the player's country has either lost or conquered over half of the board.

Note: Should such an incident happen again, please try to separate the players as soon as possible, and isolate them, before one kills someone. The German player attempted to hit me just because I am French. Unbelievable. ‐ Intern Francois Beauvillier

Input: The Battleship board game
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small, animate, plastic model of a battleship. It seeks out the nearest tiled floor before placing itself on one tile, on which it will remain until someone says the coordinates of it using the format used in the board game Battleship out loud. As soon as this happens, the model will emit a soft sound resembling an explosion, before moving to another tile.

Input: The game of chess
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A game of chess with very detailed pieces. Should a move be ordered out loud to a piece using the international chess movement encoding, it will animate itself and follow these orders. If an invalid move is given, a person different from the player gives an order, or a player gives an order before his turn to play, no piece will move. Should a piece be captured, each of the two pieces will animate and proceed to fight each other, after which the captured piece will lose and move to the side of the board.

Test 914-1787
Name: Dr. Lucius Veritas, Director of Research
Date: 12/04/2021
Total Items: One 100 gram gold bar of 99.14% purity, a 10 Euro bill, a bottle of wine. Crosstesting approved by O5 command, under condition that SCP-662 would be returned unharmed.

Note: This test is aimed to determine how predictable 914 can be when we subject it to an object that has, in certain conditions, innate knowledge of what is possible and what is not. We're doing something approximating a control test first. - Veritas

Input: One 100 gram gold bar of 99.14% purity.
Setting: Left to the prerogative of Mr. Deeds. (1:1)
Request: ''Could you please use SCP-914 to refine this object into two pieces roughly equal to each other in mass?'' Mr. Deeds dialed SCP to the 1:1 setting.
Output: Two separate cubes of gold, 99.14% purity. Mass equaled 49.91g and 50.09g respectively.

Input: A 10 Euro Bill
Setting: Left to the prerogative of Mr. Deeds. (Fine)
Request: ''Could you please use SCP-914 to refine this object into the equal value in Yen?''
Output: Thirteen small coin-shaped objects, bearing the ¥100 symbol, pressed from the materials of the Euro bill. It was noted that SCP-914 displayed uncharacteristic signs of strain, groaning with a higher volume than normal, and a black puff of smoke exited from somewhere within its inner workings. Mr. Deeds seemed to observe SCP-914 closely during the refining process. When pressed, Mr. Deeds remarked that SCP-914 was offering ''unusual resistance to [his] requests'', but claimed that it could not elaborate further. It then apologised to Dr. Veritas for not being able to follow his request.

Note: We're breaking out of standard procedure here. I'm going to be asking Mr. Deeds for outputs instead. - Veritas

Output Request: ''Two glasses of wine, procured from the bottle that I have on my desk.''
Input: Mr. Deeds placed the bottle of wine in the input booth after procuring it from the specified location, and turned SCP-914's dial to ''Fine''.
Output: SCP-914 took considerably longer to refine the object and it strained noticeably. After 22 minutes, the output booth opened. The results were two smashed wineglasses and a pool of spoiled wine.

Note: During testing, a small gear was loosened from the outer workings of SCP-914, which was launched at Mr. Deeds' head at high speed. Mr. Deeds dodged the part, after which it embedded itself into the wall behind him. After testing concluded, Mr. Deeds was requested to reinsert the gear into the inner workings of SCP-914. Mr. Deeds requested precision tools, which were granted. The repair was successful, but Mr. Deeds remarked that this was with difficulty. Further testing was aborted to avoid damaging SCP-914.

Setting: 1:1
Output: One plastic pen. Notably, the pen lights up with fluctuating colour when used for its intended purpose.

Note: A RGB pen would be useful as a last resort torch, but it’s really nothing more than a novelty. - Dr. Rose

Input: One penlight
Setting: Fine
Output: An identical penlight. When utilised in a medical examination, the subjected patient will experience severe ocular and cranial pain, and proceed to go blind. The penlight does not get progressively hotter with use, and its effects only affect individuals who stare into the pen itself.

Input: One penlight
Setting: Fine
Output: A plastic tube with a small metal button. When the button is pressed, the tube emits a light from both open ends. It is unclear where the light emanates from nor what powers the light itself. The light level is estimated to be at 130000 lumens, with a maximum distance of 3290 metres. No other anomalous properties manifested.

Input: One penlight
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One strobe light identical in size to the input. When activated, the output works as intended, despite its size. When held for between thirty-seven seconds and three minutes and nine seconds, the holder receives second and third severe burns to the full arm of the hand holding the light. The burns appear as a combination of incendiary and electrical nature. The subject will have extreme difficulty releasing the object without assistance, often requiring a minimum of three individuals to help. If not released, the burn damage continues in intensity and furthers the location damage until reaching the ocular and cranial tissue, of which the subject expires due to a combination of 3rd and 4th degree burns. When the subject dies and releases the output, it becomes inactive until held once again.

Note: I’m never going to get the smell of burnt flesh out of my coat or the medbay now. - Dr. Rose

Input: One penlight
Setting: Fine
Output: A plastic magician’s wand. When examined, one end of the wand is replaced with a small light. When held, the output works as a wand found in any magic kit, however the light activates and anonymously emits a hologram to what the wielder imagines for a “spell”. When requested, a D-Class cast a “Fireball”, and a hologram of said fireball appeared. The D-Class reported feeling the sensation of intense heat emanating from said hologram. The D-Class then attempted to escape by trying to produce an intense flash and sound. However, he managed to ''flashbang'' only himself by waving the ''wand'' in front of his own face at the wrong time, and was brought back to his cell.

Test 914-1790
Name: Researcher Connolly
Date: 18/04/2021
Total Items: Five English copies of the Poetic Edda

Input: One copy of the Poetic Edda
Setting: Rough
Output: A pile of ash, in the form of the Runic character Tiwaz (↑)

Input: One copy of the Poetic Edda
Setting: Coarse
Output: The same copy of the Poetic Edda, now translated into Old English

Input: One copy of the Poetic Edda
Setting: 1:1
Output: One copy of the Prose Edda

Input: One copy of the Poetic Edda
Setting: Fine
Output: A paper sculpture of Fenrir, the legendary wolf of Norse mythology fated to kill the god Odin during Ragnarok

Input: One copy of the Poetic Edda
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An unchanged copy of the Poetic Edda An identical copy of the Poetic Edda. Reading the copy results in an increased acquisition and retainment speed and skill of the Icelandic language.

Addendum: After D-Class testing reported no adverse effects, Researcher Connolly read the output and reported no change from the input whatsoever. Despite this apparent initial stagnation, both Researcher Connolly and the D-Class involved in testing the output showed a remarkable increase in knowledge of Icelandic, being able to recognize words and phrases merely hours after exposure, and being able to completely read and understand the Icelandic Wikipedia page after just two days.

Addendum: After prolonged testing, the D-Class complained of regular headaches and nosebleeds, notably communicating this in Icelandic. A few hours later, he suffered a stroke and expired. Researcher Connolly was subsequently admitted to the medical wing, but it is believed that his exposure to the output was not long enough to do permanent damage. Connolly reported his fluency on Icelanding fading and going back to the state before he was exposed to the output over the course of 3 days.

Test 914-1791
Name: Junior Researcher Arnolds
Date: 29/04/2021
Total Items: Five boxes of sodium bicarbonate, five spray bottles each containing 200 ml of white vinegar, five pieces of steel wool, and five cans of WD-40 brand metal lubricant

Input: One of each of the aforementioned items
Setting: Coarse
Output: One box of coarse sand, 1000 ml of nitric acid and water solution in a spray bottle, a large amount of iron filings, and a can of WD-40 brand metal delubricant, which is not a product sold by the company.

Note: After testing of the items, I’ve concluded that they would harm any machine’s maintenance approximately as badly as the originals would have helped. - JR Arnolds

Note: Oh, by the way, whoever misread the delubricant’s label and gave it to the engineering department, I think Dr. Veritas was looking for you earlier. - JR Arnolds

Input: One of each of the aforementioned items
Setting: 1:1
Output: One container of baking powder, one bottle of rice vinegar, one sponge, and one bottle of canola oil.

Input: One of each of the aforementioned items
Setting: Fine
Output: A device that resembled a paint scraper. Could scrape rust and other forms of oxidized metal off of non-oxidized metal easily. Anomalous properties demanifested within 48 hours.

Input: One of each of the aforementioned items
Setting: Fine
Output: A small metal figurine resembling a repairman. When placed near metal objects with oxidized surfaces, the figurine animated, walked to the objects, and began to perform maintenance, slowly removing oxidation from the item’s surface via non-anomalous means using a tiny spray bottle and piece of steel wool. Contained in anomalous item storage.

Input: One of each of the aforementioned items
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A black cube, approximately 0.3 meters on each side. When retrieved by the assigned D-Class, a small button on its side was accidentally pressed, causing it to emit a flash of green light that instantly removed much of the oxidation from a large section of SCP-914. Assigned D-Class collapsed within seconds due to the removal of all oxygenated hemoglobin from his body, but is expected to make a full recovery over time given iron supplements, similarly to patients suffering iron deficiency anemia, since the deoxygenated hemoglobin was not removed. Output retrieved safely by a second D-Class. Further testing revealed that the output transports all oxidized compounds containing significant amounts of metallic elements in an approximately 10-meter radius inside itself, then refines them into various pieces of pure elements, all of which can be retrieved from inside of it by opening a release latch on the top, although gaseous elements disperse immediately. Placed in anomalous containment.

Note: Interesting. This could be a good way to maintain 914 itself, although we’d have to find some way to do it without using a D-Class. We can’t make them go into anemic shock every time we want to maintain 914, it takes a long time to recover from and it’s inhumane. - JR Arnolds

Test 914-1792
Name: Junior Researcher Davidson
Date: 05/05/2021
Total Items: Four plastic bars, four steel cubes

Input: One plastic bar, one steel cube
Setting: Rough
Output: Plastic and steel strips

Input: One plastic bar, one steel cube
Setting: 1:1
Output: One plastic cube held together with steel bolts

Input: One plastic bar, one steel cube
Setting: Fine
Output: One Colt 1911 pistol with a plastic magazine. When a bullet is fired out of the pistol, it ricochets until it loses its momentum. During testing, it was discovered that any type of bullet can be loaded into the magazine. The magazine anomalously transforms the bullets into .45 ACP ammunition, which is the standard ammunition for this pistol model.

Input: One plastic bar, one steel cube
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A steel box with a plastic lid that freezes anything that touches the box. When opened, the box releases a fog composed of ice crystals. The fog was measured to have a temperature of -60°C. Being exposed to the fog without protective gear for more than half a minute causes frostbite. Two attempts at neutralization were made. Researchers were able to defrost the inside of the box, only for the anomalous properties to return twenty-four hours later. Further attempts at neutralization were not made due to the box's ability to restore its properties.

Note: To avoid incidents, the box is to be destroyed as soon as possible. – JR Davidson

Note: Turns out incinerating it works, who would have thought it! - Veritas

Test 914-1793
Name: Researcher Connolly
Date: 05/05/2021
Total Items: Five diagrams of the Homo sapiens anatomical position

Input: One diagram of the anatomical position
Setting: Rough
Output: A diagram of a neuron

Input: One diagram of the anatomical position
Setting: Coarse
Output: A diagram of the anatomical position of Australopithecus afarensis, an earlier stage of human evolution

Input: One diagram of the anatomical position
Setting: 1:1
Output: One diagram of the anatomical position for a canine

Note: Interesting that this is what it chose to equate humanity with. - Researcher Connolly

Note: Connolly, 914 isn't comparing humanity to anything, it spits out a paper portraying something of roughly equal complexity. Canines are roughly 85% equal to humans genetically anyway. - Veritas

Input: One diagram of the anatomical position
Setting: Fine
Output: A detailed drawing of a quantum computation apparatus

Input: One diagram of the anatomical position
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A diagram of SCP-914 Initially a diagram of SCP-914, however after approximately 42 minutes, the diagram changed to a revised diagram of the Homo sapiens anatomical position with notable changes to the anatomy and physiology. Changes included a larger cranium size, longer and presumably more prehensile toes, increased muscle mass in the extremities, the beginnings of what appear to be a tail, and a noticeable absence of sexual organs.

Addendum: After another 42 minutes, the diagram once again changed, this time reverting to the diagram of SCP-914, with the diagram matching all schematics of SCP-914 in the Foundation’s custody. Similar to those, however, the diagram was, at most, 24% complete, as attempting to charter more of SCP-914 would require disassembling extremely delicate and intricate clockwork, which was never attempted due to high likelihood of damaging it.

Test 914-1794
Name: Network Technician Rare
Date: 06/05/2021
Total Items: One Intel iAPX 86 16-bit computer central processing unit

Input: One iAPX 86 CPU
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One computer CPU, matching no known design. Connects via a unique two-row slot-type socket.

Addendum: A socket was successfully reverse-engineered for the output, and it has been found to use the standard x86 instruction set. During testing, the output was found to absorb heat via unknown means, rather than producing it as a result of electrical resistance. The increase in current due to this overloaded the circuits of the test computer, causing significant damage to the motherboard and rendering it inoperable.

Test 914-1795
Name: Junior Researcher Cens
Date: 06/05/2021
Total Items: Seven Frixion-brand Erasable Fine-liner pens (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and black), One Seagate 4 TB External hard drive with multiple video games each of variable completion

Input: Three fine-liner pens (red, yellow, blue)
Setting: 1:1
Output: Three pens of the same brand and type (orange, green, purple)

Note: Interesting how the output pens are different shades of the orange, green, and purple of the normal and original pens. - J.R. Cens

Input: Previous output, three other fine liner pens (orange, green, purple)
Setting: Coarse
Output: One pile of plastic shavings, large puddle of erasable cement ink made up of the three colors input

Note: Okay, that's to be expected, but what about black? - J.R. Cens

Input: One fine liner pen (black)
Setting Fine
Output: Physically unchanged pen. When used to draw over redacted text, the cement will dissolve the ink being used to hide the original text and subsequently turn invisible, allowing users to “unredact” certain parts of documents. Output placed in Anomalous Storage.

Note: As tempting or useful as this might be in the future, I really don't feel like accidentally unredacting an infohazard or something of similar consequence, so this is being put away. How about we move on? I've wanted to do this one for a while. - J.R. Cens

Input: Aforementioned Seagate hard drive
Setting: Fine
Output: One model “Northstar” Titan from the video game Titanfall 2. Stemming from one of the rear jets of the model is a USB-A cable. Plugging this cable into any gaming console with a compatible port will allow access to the games (and their progress/multiplayer data) found on the original input.

Addendum: During anomalous testing (twelve hours after this test was completed), the model began levitating through unknown means and started firing pieces of the original Seagate's internal components at researchers using its rear mounted launchers. Researchers in the room could reportedly hear the model loudly saying various quotes from one of Titanfall 2's antagonists, “Viper”. After the model was restrained, the cable was plugged back into the test console, and it was determined that the files were still accessible, making the model's method of file storage unclear. Files backed up for further testing, researchers treated for lacerations, and model incinerated.

Test 914-1796
Name: Junior Researcher Boneka
Date: 10/05/2021
Total Items: Three bicycles

Input: One bicycle
Setting: 1:1
Output: Two unicycles

Input: One bicycle
Setting: 1:1
Output: One tricycle missing its front wheel

Input: One bicycle
Setting: Fine
Output: One bicycle with its wheels oriented sideways, parallel to the ground. It was discovered that the output is capable of riding on walls if given enough momentum. However, due to the awkward orientation of the wheels, it is extremely difficult to pedal.

Input: All above inputs
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A large spherical cage constructed by swathes of gyrating wheels, wires, and metal poles. A bicycle seat is anomalously suspended in the center, attached to nothing; however, it is impossible to enter the output due to there being no actual entrance anywhere on it. It also appears that there is no room for a person to sit inside the cage, and that attempting to do so would likely result in severe injuries, due to the constantly moving poles and wires surrounding the seat.

Note: I think this one should be called an "omnicycle". - JR Boneka

Test 914-1797
Name: Dr. Noelle Cahill
Date: 11/05/2021
Total Items: Four plastic bags of cotton for stuffing four "King"-sized mattresses

Input: One bag of cotton mattress stuffing
Setting: 1:1
Output: One woven cotton bag of plastic fibres

Input: One bag of cotton mattress stuffing
Setting: Fine
Output: One rolled sleeping bag woven from the inputted cotton in a plastic case

Note: Testing conducted with multiple D-Class subjects revealed no hidden anomalous properties, though Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry reported feeling unease when viewing the output. - Dr. Cahill

Input: One bag of cotton mattress stuffing
Setting: Fine
Output: One fully-stuffed "Queen"-sized mattress

Input: One bag of cotton mattress stuffing
Setting: Fine
Output: One human-sized teddy bear

Note: Extensive testing, to the point of dissection, has revealed nothing anomalous at all. This is extremely unexpected - three outputs on Fine with no anomalous properties whatsoever? I will be incinerating the output, just in case. - Dr. Cahill

Addendum: When the incinerator was activated, the output manifested the ability to independently animate clumps of cotton stuffing, attempting to ensnare Dr. Cahill and accompanying D-Class personnel into the plastic-lined teddy bear shell, then propelling itself towards the incinerator. Fortunately, D-69718 saved Dr. Cahill by pushing her away from the output before being dragged into the incinerator and terminated with the output. Next-of-kin have been compensated and D-69718 received a posthumous pardon for outstanding service to the Foundation.

Test 914-1798
Name: Junior Researcher Evangeline Perry
Date: 18/05/2021
Total Items: One ticket for an amusement park

Input: One ticket for an amusement park
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A year pass that randomly changes to depict a pass for different amusement parks. Attempting to use the pass to book a visit an amusement park will cause it to shift to a different amusement park than the one nearby.

Note: Well that was embarrassing, when standing at the entry gate. - J.R. Perry

Test 914-1799
Name: Intern Scott
Date: 18/05/2021
Total Items: One bottle of "Hugo Boss" aftershave

Input: Bottle of aftershave
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One bottle of "914 Brand" aftershave. Applying to skin causes the wearer to act more provocative and flirtatious.

Note: D-Class subject that was tested on is now in the hospital wing after suffering a broken nose from Junior Researcher Perry.

Note: The next one who comes to make a comment about my ass behind again will get more than just a broken nose. - J.R. Perry

Note: Guy had it coming to him. - Intern Scott
